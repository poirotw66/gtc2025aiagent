 Howdy, folks, and welcome to the Venture Capital Reverse Pitch. My name is Troy Estes, and I sit on the Developer Relations team over here at NVIDIA, and I'm going to be moderating today's session. I'm joined by three awesome speakers. We have Javier Nunez-Vicandi, a principal of the Digital Medicine Fund over at Sofanova Partners. We have Kaylee Chill, the chief investment officer at OurCrowd. And we have Victoria Lieta, investment director of Swisscom Ventures. And before I pass it over to our awesome speakers, I just want to say thank you folks so much for joining today's session. You know, here at NVIDIA, we really care about the ecosystem, and it's really important to us to have these awesome and vibrant communities, but also to connect these communities together. So it's really cool that we're able to do this reverse pitch and connect our VC community to our startup community. In a bit of a unique format where these VCs are sort of pitching their funds to the startups as opposed to the startups pitching to the VCs. The last thing I'll say is that we do have a Q&A module that I encourage you to use. It's on your screen. We're going to be in the background answering questions the whole time. So I encourage you to put all your questions there. And without further ado, I'd love to introduce the speakers and then get into the fund pitching part of the session. Javier, do you want to introduce yourself briefly? Yeah, sure. Happy to. Thanks, Troy. And thanks for having me here at the GTC Reverse Pitch. For everyone, I'm Javier. I'm a principal at the fund. As Troy said, I'm excited to tell you about what we do. Doctor by training, sort of nerd at heart, and now investing to try and figure out how to scale healthcare. Happy to be here. Awesome. Kaylee, do you want to take the ball and introduce yourself? Absolutely. Really glad to be here. I'm Kaylee Chill. I joined AppCrowd about six years ago. I come from the world of lawyers and M&A deals. But after about 20 years of doing that, I've sort of transitioned into VC, joined AppCrowd in 2019, and now I'm their chief investment officer. Awesome. And Victoria? Hi, everyone. It's really good to be here. I'm Victoria. I'm an investment director at Swisscon Ventures. I have a business background, worked for an industrial technology firm for 10 years. I was part of their venture capital arm for the last couple of years there, investing in areas such as energy, robotics, industrial automation, and basically now since two years with Swisscon Ventures. It's great to be here. Awesome. And thank you so much to you three for joining this session. I really appreciate it and really enjoy working with you. Javier, you're our first speaker. We'd love to give the floor to you and have you talk a little bit more about Sofinova. It's a pleasure to meet you all. And thanks for attending. I'm here to tell you about Sofinova Partners and Sofinova Digital Medicine Fund in particular. So for those of you that don't know Sofinova Partners, we're a longstanding 50-plus-year venture capital firm that specialized in life sciences. With 2.8 billion in dedicated AUM, we are one of Europe's largest specialist firms with offices in Paris, London, and Milan, as well as a strong presence in the US. And we've had the privilege over the years of funding some transformational companies in the life science space. As a firm, we're now 80-plus professionals in size, covering over 24 nationalities and growing. And I think what makes our firm special is that fundamentally we are scientists, both PhDs, MDs, and other specialists that understand the technologies we invest in and use that to hopefully build large-scale companies that transform our investment sector. And over the years, Sofinova has built up a number of strategies across different stages and different sectors within the life science value chain. Everything from early-stage company builders, both at biotech and in medtech, early-stage funds inside biotech investing, as well as late-stage crossover funds investing in clinical assets. But today, I'm here to tell you about the fund that I'm from, a fund that's very special to my heart, the Digital Medicine Fund. And fundamentally, that's a $200 million vehicle dedicated to unlocking the power of medicine via the intersection of data and compute as applied to life sciences and healthcare. We believe that COVID-19 was ultimately medicine's iPhone moment. It was a moment that showcased not only the importance of healthcare to all our lives, but also the fragility of our ecosystem and our systems when they were challenged by an unforeseen virus. And we believe this is evidence of a broader trend that has been happening for years. There's a top-down, inevitable supply-demand mismatch that exists across healthcare and life sciences. With healthcare costs going up over time, driven by age and structural changes in our workforce, as well as increasingly large costs for developing novel treatments, we see an inevitable challenging being able to deliver healthcare at the quality that we all look both today and for future generations. And bottom-up, we are convinced that data and computation are the answer to that problem, as a deflationary force that can ultimately enable us to deliver healthcare at the scale that's necessary. Biology and the way we've approached life sciences has historically been forced to take a reductionist approach. Fundamentally, we couldn't understand the complexity of the system, so we focused on a small part of it and took huge translational risk when trying to convert that small piece of understanding into the human. We believe that now the tooling exists such that we can really build a different approach to discovering novel biology, leveraging new AI-driven tools, new unique data sets that ultimately unlock new platform opportunities as a venture investor. And we think that this trend is only accelerating. If you look back from the early ages when the Oath of Hippocrates was first undertaken, through to the discovery of penicillin, the completion of the Human Genome Project, and ultimately technologies such as AlphaFull that just won the Nobel Prize, there's an acceleration driven by compounding advantages in software and data-driven technologies, which leads us to believe that this is the future of life sciences as a segment. Pausing for a second to talk about why we think this is necessary, a dedicated fund is necessary to succeed in this space, we think that there's a different J-curve to building these data-driven, compute-driven companies in life sciences. And as a result of that, we have a vehicle with specialist investors that focuses exclusively on that segment. And ultimately, we believe that this creation of large platform compute companies in life sciences leads to a change in how medicine is practiced. From a past situation where we were giving populations broad-spectrum medications that ultimately addressed large indications, through to a present reality where we're increasingly more precision-driven, trying to find the right drug for the right patient, to ultimately a future which we think is personalized fundamentally, leveraging the suite of technologies that exist to enable a dedicated, unique treatment plan for every individual, and payment on a system level that ultimately reflects the outcomes that are achieved in each specific patient. And if there's any slide to take away from this presentation, it's this one. We believe that investing in digital medicine requires a fundamentally different approach to what's existed in the past. We look at the world through new technologies and existing technologies, as well as new channels and existing channels. And if you break down the world through that lens, what you find is that generalist tech has historically been very good at investing in existing technologies and building new channels around them. In our view, companies like Netflix, but also companies like Crew, ultimately delivered huge value by taking something that someone, taking a technology or form that already existed, video, and distributing that through a new channel, the internet. Equally, new technology, existing channel, is the traditional playground of biotech VCs, you know, generating a new molecule, translating that out of the scientific community, and ultimately eventually selling that to a pharmaceutical company that has the distribution and commercialization chops to be able to actually scale that in the market. And we think that digital medicine is fundamentally different. And this is where we think that a dedicated vehicle has an edge. Our sector has both new technologies and new channels. And it's an understanding in building those that ultimately you're able to generate large-scale returns and large-scale outcomes that ultimately will define the future of this industry. We divide our sectors of investment across three broad categories. The easiest way to think about them is across the life cycle of the patient. Enabling technologies is everything that comes before the patient, how you can accelerate the innovation paradigm of life sciences to get new medications, new treatments to patients quicker. Analytics, how you generate and leverage data sets directly from the patient to help inform treatment for that patient. And ultimately, the treatment vertical, which ultimately is how you use software and AI to directly deliver care to the patient. And, you know, we're only as exciting as our portfolio is. And so to give you a sense of the kinds of companies we invest in, I have a few examples from our portfolio to talk you through. One of our most exciting investments is a company called Bioptimus, a French company that's unlocking the foundations of biology by building the first multimodal, multiscale model that connects the different layers of biology together. It's connecting DNA, RNA, proteins, cells into tissues, into the patient phenotype or symptoms. And by doing that, finally allows us to understand the rich complexity of biology in order to be able to understand how we have to modulate it in order to be able to actually achieve the outcome we want in patients. Led by a world-class team of researchers from Aukin, DeepMind and other places, we're exceptionally excited to back Bioptimus here in France. Another example of a company that we just announced recently is Latent Labs. Again, another frontier model for proteins in this case, where Bioptimus is an encoder, Latent Labs is a decoder for biology, allowing us to build proteins in novel and interesting ways that ultimately allows us to identify novel structures and novel molecules using a best-in-class generative approach. The founder here is Simon Cole, with some of the early team in AlphaFold, and we're super excited to be backing his company and his technology moving forward. And finally, one in near and dear to my heart, Cure51. This is again another French company that is unlocking the secrets of cancer survival. Assembling the world's largest multi-omic database of exceptional survivors, Cure51 is flipping the paradigm of translational research on its head. Instead of looking at why people get sick, it's looking at why people survive. In metastatic cancer, sadly, most patients die within 11 to 14 months. Cure51 is looking at patients that survive for five-plus years with metastatic cancer, de novo sequencing these patients, and ultimately trying to understand what about their biology is driving this exceptional survival. To do this and to find these exceptionally rare patients, Cure51 has had to build one of the largest oncology studies ever performed, extending across 50 world-leading international centers and growing rapidly, working with some of the best cancer researchers on the planet to be able to ultimately make everyone a survivor. Founded by two excellent entrepreneurs with a background in both technology and in life sciences, we're super excited about the data-driven capabilities that Cure51 unlocks and where that takes us as a firm. Ultimately, you know, all good pitches should end in an ask. And so we think that the time is now for Sofinova's long history of leadership in life sciences to be combined with a dedicated team that's exclusively focused on investing at the intersection of AI and biology. And, you know, to the founders in the audience that see the world like we do and see this paradigm shift in what is possible in our industry using data and compute, please get in touch. We'd be excited to have a conversation about what you guys are building and how we can hopefully support the value creation journey that you're on in order to be able to build the large-scale life science platform companies of the future. So, you know, with that, I'll hand over back to Troy for the other great pitches. And it's a pleasure to be with you all here today. Thanks, Javier, for the awesome presentation. Really appreciate it. Kayleigh, the floor is yours. Love to hear from you and from OurCrab. Hey, Troy. Thanks very much. So, who is OurCrab? OurCrab is basically a platform. We are a global venture investment platform. And we invest in startups and in funds. And we're connecting our startups with powerful network of corporate partners, investors, and industry leaders. So, what is it basically? We basically built a website about 11 years ago to create the connection between the startup world and the investor. But it's not just any investors. We basically came to democratize this world of venture investing. Based on our experience, there's a very, very small segment of the population that's able to invest in venture. You have to be very, very wealthy, and you have to be able to put down sizable amounts. But OurCrab built a platform that allows investors that are still accredited investors, but much smaller at scale, to put in as little as $10,000 into a startup or $50,000 into a fund. This platform over the last 11 years has basically amassed $2.3 billion in AUM, invested in 480 portfolio companies, built 59 funds and feeder funds into third-party GPs, and has generated 68 exits. So, what are we providing access to? For our startups, we see ourselves as providing access to strategic hands-on mentorship, vast network of multinational corporations, and strategic partners. If you look at some of the logos on this slide here, Stifel, which is a big, I think, number seven bank in the United States, or Oryx, a Japanese conglomerate, SoftBank, these are not just names that we have partnered with. These are actually GPs that have invested in OurCrab. And we lean deeply on these types of relationships. When we come to investing in startups, we can definitely leverage these relationships to help open doors for the companies that we invest in. So, let's talk about diversity. OurCrab is pretty much agnostic when it comes to the sectors it's investing in. We're all over the place. We invest in AI, obviously, but medtech, mobility, climate, clean tech energy, all of the above. What we're trying to do is cater to the flavors and tastes of as many investors that come to the OurCrab platform. Today, there's about 240,000 people that are registered on our site. So, you can imagine that we get people seeking different things. We're also diversified across stages. Many, many companies are at the seed stage, like maybe I would say about 30% of our portfolio. 27% are early stage, series A, series B. 27% go into growth. Whereas the late stage, what we call the pre-IPO companies, getting ready to go public or get acquired, are at around 16%. And we're also diversified geographically because once we started this website and this whole business, it was very much Israel-centric. That's back in 2013, 2014. But fast forward 10 years, I would say only about 50% of the companies we invest in are Israeli. About 35% are in the U.S. and the rest are rest of world. So, what have we generated so far in terms of exits? As you can see on this slide, we've basically had about 68 exits in the last 11 years. Some of the names that you can see here, companies like Microsoft, Intel, have acquired the businesses that we've been backing. And we've also seen some pretty sizable NASDAQ and NICE appearances from companies like Beyond Meat or Lemonade. I like to talk about our business in two main categories. We invest in funds, again, mostly VC, but also other internal alternative assets. And then we have our direct company investments, the startups. So, when we talk about funds for a minute, we also have to divide this into several segments. Our funds business is divided into internal funds. So, these are funds where our crowd is the GP, we're managing the funds, we're deciding what to invest in. Then we have external funds where we're basically placing a bet on a third-party fund or an external GP and just creating a feeder as an LP into that fund. So, then our investors come with their 50, 100, $200,000 checks, right? Relatively small. You can't get into a fund like Lightspeed with 50 or $100,000, but you can through our crowd. And that's what brings us to our list of external venture funds, which we're very, very proud of. We invest in funds like USVP, Lightspeed, Harpoon, Soma Capital, Draper Associates. These are some of the top brands that are leading VC in the world today. We also have wonderful investments in Israeli funds, funds such as Tekavib or Tendee, which we've been partnering with for many years. And of course, we also have our own internal funds. So, our internal funds are divided into index funds where we're basically creating an index to invest in the companies that are coming to the R-Cout platform. And we also have our sector-based themed funds. We have a cybersecurity fund or an AI fund, which is a fund that we are in partnership with NVIDIA Inception. We have a food tech fund and others. On the right side of the screen, we also have other alternative asset funds. These are funds such as Arrow, that's basically investing in non-performing loans, or Upper 90, which is an asset-based lending fund. And we also have funds that are focused on private equity or GP-led secondaries. So, let's talk about our companies because I'm assuming that most of our audience here are more interested in that side of the business. Again, we divide it into two buckets. We have access deals, and we have our managed deals. What's the difference? The access deals are investments into much, much later stage companies where we're really only going to be a tiny little blip in the overall cap table of the company. So, think of a company like Databricks, right? It's already worth billions of dollars. It's generating billions of dollars in revenues. Our crowd can allow its investors with, again, as little as $10,000 to get a piece of a small partnership that's going to invest in Databricks. Or Anthropic, you know, one of the largest LLM companies around today. So, these are, again, companies where we're pretty much passive. We're allowing our investors to get exposure to those companies, but we're not going to bring them much value, obviously. But then where it gets interesting is our managed deals. And here, we're reinvesting a company like Zutacore, for example, mentioned on this slide. That's a company that's doing some pretty cool cooling, no pun intended, of data centers. It's a company that's based in Israel. We've just capitalized it with a pretty sizable check. We are very close with the company. We talk to the CEO at least once a month. And these are sort of regular venture capital stakes that we take with, you know, very close proximity to the businesses and helping them with their growth. How do we work? We have multiple SPV structure for making our direct investments. So, as you can see in this illustration, an investor comes along. They want to invest in a certain company that they see listed on the menu of companies on our website. They basically, through the website, in a pretty seamless fashion, can sign up to that SPV, that special purpose vehicle, and capitalize. They wire their money. And about a few weeks later, once all the money is in from all our investors, we then send one check and we become a shareholder, just like any VC, in the portfolio company. From the portfolio company's perspective, they're dealing with a regular VC. They don't know that there's maybe 60 or 160 people in the special purpose vehicle up top. They're only dealing with an OurCrowd representative with a regular fund manager who's managing that SPV. Let's talk about our sector strengths. AI, of course, is all the buzz these days. I'm very proud to say that OurCrowd is actually the number one most active investor from an Israeli in this geography here where I'm located, AI companies, but we're also pretty high up on the chart for global AI investing. Number 15 as of the end of 2024 based on pitch book data. So we've so far put $500 million to work in artificial intelligence companies, and that's in over 100 companies. So we're very, very proud to be in partnership with NVIDIA when it comes to our AI fund. And that's what I want to talk about next. We've put together an AI fund, which is targeting investments into about 20, maybe 30 investments. We're going to reserve about 30% of the capital for follow-on investments in these companies. And this is a fund that's already pretty much up and running. We've made numerous investments in some very exciting companies. We do the early stage, right? The managed, like I mentioned earlier, but we also do the later stage, companies like Anthropic, which are exposed to by this fund. So this is a way for an investor to really be diversified in terms of the stages across many different layers of AI investments. We also have been investing a lot in quantum. So for example, there's a company called Heka Security. It's a very small Israeli company, which we'll talk about in a minute. And this is a company we've invested in in 2018, or a company called Classic, which we invested in five years ago. Again, quantum is one of these hot areas where in recent years, it took a while for these investments to fill up. But today, if we're putting a quantum company on our cloud platform, this thing is getting filled up very, very quickly. We're very careful to choose the very best of these companies. And we're proud to be one of the top investors in this sector. Another very interesting area that we have at our cloud, which is maybe unique to our platform, is our cloud incubators. So as opposed to a regular VC, where they may be doing very early seed investments, we're actually even going to the pre-seed incubation stage for many companies. We have seven incubators, five of them in Israel. One of them is based in New Zealand, Sprout, and one most recently in Uruguay, in Latin America. So these are really pretty much the earliest stage investments we make. And the idea is that these, or the best of these companies, will actually graduate from incubation and hopefully come to the platform. So remember we mentioned Heka. Heka Security is a great example of a company that we invested in from the incubator about six, seven years ago. And it's come a long way. And it's now come to the platform. And the platform is investing. And hopefully, we want to be able to say that we'll continue to stand by this company as it comes for Series B and Series C and hopefully all the way to IPO or a sale of it. How do we help our startups? Well, I'd like to say that we pretty much leverage our global venture ecosystem. So remember, we've been building this thing for 11 years. We've got all these investors and multinational corporations and institutional investors. So all these stakeholders are now converging on the OurCrowd platform. And we can connect our companies using this network. So some of the areas that we connect companies in, fundraising support, obviously. We're always doing follow-on rounds and we're one of the biggest followers of our own companies in the industry. Helping with operational strategy, business development opportunities, human resources. For example, we'll see a company soon where we pretty much found their CEO that has now taken them to the next level. And of course, connecting them with investment bankers or whoever they need to to figure out the right exit opportunities. So we've actually done $900 million in follow-on rounds. It's a little bit unique for OurCrowd to be able to do that because with a regular VC, at some point, you run out of money. But with OurCrowd, you could always go back to the crowd. You go back to the investors who are in the SPV and if they like what's going on, they'll re-up. And you can always go out to a new pool of investors. So it's very easy for us to try and connect the startups with more capital. We've also connected them with 1,700 multinational corporations that are within our network. And of course, there's many corporate executives that we have connections with to help our startups. Here's an example of a company called Oncohost. They're transforming the approach to precision medicine for improved patient outcomes in clinical oncology. Well, we used our connection with a known industry expert. Hilah, her name is. Today, she's a managing partner with Patango, one of the leading VCs. We pretty much brought her to a company and said, this is the best board member we can bring to help drive your value. And Hilah has been a huge asset for Oncohost since. We also have a wonderful network of co-investors. So if you look at this slide, you can see that OurCrad is really investing alongside some of the biggest names, names like Kasla and Andreessen Horowitz. We're finding investments and getting into deals alongside some of the biggest. And in terms of our network of strategic relationships, I think we've already covered this, but it goes across distribution partners, just corporate partners. Of course, we talked about co-investors, the incubation program, and pretty much regular interaction with all of the strategic partners we've been talking about. Multinational corporations is one thing that we're very proud about at OurCrad. We have a lot of these in our network, and we keep connecting them with the startups. So not only for deals, but also for business development purposes, we've pretty much opened many, many doors, many times, for many of our companies to their satisfaction. And here's something very interesting that, again, not every VC has. We have something that we call the Custom Corporate Fund, or CCF, where basically it's an investment vehicle that allows corporate investors to allocate their funds for investments in OurCrad portfolio companies. So think of, you know, a corporate that does not have a VC and now is able to invest in startups through this program. It helps the VC, right, because now through OurCrad, it's able to access the companies, but it also helps the companies to connect them with the corporates. A Treepon Fund is one of the last things I want to talk about in terms of how we bring spectacular reach globally for our startups. So Treepon was a fund that we put together, which basically is a U.S., Israeli, Korean fund for investing in companies from those three locations. It's an $80 million fund and it's backed by the Korean government. So we actually have an investment committee which is made up by people from these three locations and doing deals with the idea of scaling Israeli companies or Silicon Valley companies into the scale-up nation of Korea. This is something that we've actually experienced now with a few investments that we've made and we feel is working pretty well. In terms of some examples of companies that we've been with for a long time, I think BioCatch is probably one of the best examples. So this is a company we got in pretty early back when you know, BioCatch was a small company got in at a pretty early stage but now it's at $1.3 billion and this is a company that we've actually added a lot of value because we actually helped bring a CEO that's leading this company to great things today and we've made more than 60 targeted introductions to high-level executives and financial institutions many of which have you know, brought business to this company. Gadi Mazur you know, who's the CEO that we brought is a great spokesperson for us and we're very proud of the partnership with him and BioCatch. Halo is another great example of a company we got in very early and reached over $1 billion in valuation today. So it's another one of these unicorns that we can definitely point to specific value add that we've brought to the table in order to help them advance. And I won't go through this but pretty much you know, company after company that we have been in touch with are great you know, advocates of our crowd and how the platform works and how the network brings value. I think with that I'll conclude my remarks and turn it back to Troy. I really look forward to connecting with, you know, startups that find our crowd to be of interest. Yeah, thank you so much, Kayleigh. Our crowd is so unique you know, in the way that you guys do things so I always hear I always enjoy hearing about it and getting to learn more so thank you so much. Great. Love to pass the ball over to Victoria and learn more about Swisscom Ventures. Victoria, the floor is yours. Thank you so much. Thanks again for having me. I'm here today to introduce you to Swisscom Ventures. Swisscom Ventures is the VC arm of Swisscom and Swisscom is the incumbent telco and largest IT service provider in Switzerland. So Swisscom has actually been around since 2007 already and we have invested in almost 90 companies. We had 37 exits to date and this included four IPOs including on Nasdaq. So while we're obviously connected to Swisscom we actually have quite a special setup because we're not only investing Swisscom's money. So basically about 25% of the capital that we do deploy comes from Swisscom and the rest actually comes from institutional investors. In that sense we invest from a fully financial perspective and our primary mandate is to make returns for our investors and nevertheless we find it obviously very important to kind of capture the strategic value that Swisscom can provide for our portfolio companies and vice versa. So for that we have a dedicated team that is basically responsible for connecting our portfolio companies with Swisscom. So from an investment strategy point of view we have a dual approach inside and outside Switzerland. We invest about 50% in Switzerland and the rest in the US, Europe and Israel. So in Switzerland we would typically invest as a lead investor and it's kind of we have a bit of a I would say more flexible approach to at what stage we invest. We're typically a series A, B investor that's our sweet spot in Switzerland we can also go a bit earlier outside Switzerland we can also go later. So we have a bit of flexibility also kind of from a kind of investment statistics or strategy point strategy point of view when we invest internationally we would typically kind of see ourselves as a value adding strategic investor and typically co-invest or in some cases co-lead with a top tier international VCs. So from a kind of ticket size point of view obviously it depends a bit on the round size and kind of the maturity of the company but we would invest typically 2 to 5 and up to 10 million in initial kind of an initial round and then reverse obviously capital to continue investing in companies that where it makes sense. So as a we really see ourselves as a long-term partner and we want to continue investing kind of in our portfolio company over the long for the long term. Now looking a bit more at the investment verticals we generally focus on sectors of domain expertise and proven track record over the past 15 years from our team. So if we look at these verticals we invest in technologies that really drive digital transformation in different areas. This can include both software and hardware enabled solutions and as you can see we have a strong focus on infrastructure and cloud data and AI ICT and connectivity as well as enterprise software in different verticals so for example in cyber security fintech or edtech. Now here is also where our dual investment focus comes in again a bit mostly in Switzerland we also invest more broadly and next what I already said we would also invest in areas such as for example semiconductors photonics space technologies industrial and robotics technologies agriculture tech and digital health. So one of our approaches is also to do deep dives in a subset of these verticals through kind of in-depth market studies and this obviously also helps us to proactively identify the most interesting drivers for these areas. Looking at our portfolio we currently have 55 active investments and you can see here it's really well distributed across the different areas I talked about and we are very very proud to also support some of the Swiss growth companies and category leaders just to maybe pick one example if we look at antibiotics antibiotics is a global leader in AI driven robotic inspection solutions they have raised in total over 130 million US dollars from investors such as Qualcomm Ventures Walden Catalyst Bessemer and TDK Ventures so we actually invested in antibiotics in their Series A in 2020 and maybe in kind of another example would be XFARM it's also one of our portfolio companies they're focusing on digitalization of the agri-food sector so they basically provide tools that can support farmers and stakeholders in the management of their businesses and their farms and they actually raised nearly 60 million so far and their latest round was led by Partec so moving a bit more towards kind of the value add that we can bring I mean I already mentioned before that we have a team that connects our portfolio companies to Swisscom now from an impact point of view just specifically looking at the value add for startups we really try to open up where it makes sense and where this is mutually beneficial the Swisscom network to our portfolio companies so as already mentioned Swisscom is actually the leading ICT company in Switzerland and with their companies Fast Hub and Vodafone they're the strong number two in the Italian market so in Switzerland only Swisscom serves about 250,000 SME customers 2,500 corporate customers and 300 multinational customers and this is really kind of where we want to help our portfolio companies to get access to that network to have direct contact with their customers depending on the stage having different approaches whether it's kind of lightweight collaboration all the way to reselling and joint development so as an example certain portfolio companies we integrate them in the Swisscom's P2B third-party service platform and that is kind of the network that we can open up additionally there is obviously also a team of very smart people within Swisscom and we provide access to this export that ranges from kind of operations from technical development from finance sales HR you name it so in summary we really offer entrepreneurs access to our technical infrastructure but also to the market channels and I mean this is obviously in addition to all the other elements where a kind of traditional financial VC would support their companies like leveraging the global VC networks and industry networks and so on so a bit more deeper looking at these areas of collaboration a first element is the kind of joint development effort with the B2B business I've already kind of mentioned before this third-party service platform where we kind of like add our portfolio companies to additionally Swisscom also collaborates with startups to augment its own kind of internal operations so in this context for example we run POCs via the Swisscom Outpost Swisscom Outpost is basically an office established in 1998 in Silicon Valley and their role is to identify and develop solutions to support Swisscom and its customers so they really foster a close exchange and cooperation between kind of the large technology firms and startups to kind of address customer needs and market requirements so we are I would say on top of that also obviously very well aware of kind of what other areas Swisscom is looking to find external partners for and so we're also actively try to facilitate those introductions so we have a very regular systematic exchange with different parts of the organization so one of these examples is the so-called venture associate network it's a group that is consisting of experts from different parts of the business which we connect with on a monthly basis and kind of exchange on companies respectively learn from them what they're looking for and in that way facilitate those business introductions and client introductions maybe more specifically I'm going to kind of illustrate this with an example so let me for example quickly talk about Cato networks so Cato is basically pioneered the convergence of networking and security into the cloud so their kind of aim is to deliver a next generation IT security platform that really eliminates the complexity and the costs and the risks that are associated with kind of legacy IT approaches so we invested in Cato in 2021 and kind of initiated a discussion with Swisscom and that eventually led to a strategic partnership with a subsidiary of Swisscom so the subsidiary is called United Security Providers they're a provider of IT security solutions and managed security services and they have expanded their portfolio with managed services based on Cato networks so that is one example to provide maybe a second one we also have a portfolio company called Bitmoving we first invested in 2021 in their series C Bitmoving is a provider of video streaming infrastructure and kind of the introduction and kind of ongoing facilitation of that conversation between Bitmoving and Swisscom led in 2023 to Swisscom actually deploying the Bitmoving player for its blue TV service kind of enabling clients to get a superior kind of viewing experience through that collaboration so considering we're here talking in the context of NVIDIA GTC I also wanted to briefly mention the Swisscom collaboration with NVIDIA to build a generative AI full-stack supercomputer based on the NVIDIA accelerated computing and software this is called the Swiss AI platform and Swisscom is creating an infrastructure for developing trustworthy AI applications and giving customers the flexible access to NVIDIA supercomputers to AI services to an AI work hub for developing AI solutions and the library of models and it's intended to be a one-stop shop for AI solutions providing basically everything everything from advice to operations in specific applications and this is being rolled out and partnerships within this ecosystem will also become more important in the next phase so we are in close contact with the team to discuss and see where it makes sense that our portfolio companies could also profit from this tool so I also kind of wanted to give you a bit of a view of the team that is behind this so we have a team of 17 people supporting our portfolio companies and working with our investors and Swisscom we are a partner led team meaning that we have three managing partners that lead our team together and we all have specific focus areas connected to the verticals I presented before and we are all as a team based in Switzerland so the different team members have a very diverse backgrounds with people from degrees from institutions like ETH and EPFL and MIT so from technology science backgrounds as well as finance then we also have different team members that founded their own companies and growth startups in Europe and Asia so a very broad expertise that we like to bring to the table when we work with our startup partners so with this I hope I could share a bit what we do and how we work at Swisscom Ventures and I would obviously be thrilled if you reach out so we can see if there is a way of partnering together going forward and yeah with that thank you very much it was great pleasure to introduce Swisscom Ventures to you yeah thank you Victoria awesome to hear about Swisscom and also
