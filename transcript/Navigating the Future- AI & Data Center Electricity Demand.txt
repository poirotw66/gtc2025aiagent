 Hello, welcome to GTC. My name is Josh Parker. I lead corporate sustainability at NVIDIA, and I am thrilled this morning to be speaking with Laura Cozzi from the International Energy Agency. We're very excited to have the IEA participate with us at GTC this year. The IEA has been doing some really interesting work in energy modeling for decades, and recently they've been adding very significant information and analysis that's been influential specifically on the area of data centers and AI. Laura was appointed the International Energy Agency's Director of Sustainability, Technology, and Outlooks in 2023. She leads and coordinates the IEA's work on energy sustainability, encompassing energy technology policy, and climate change. She is also the agency's chief energy modeler, and in this capacity, co-leads the World Energy Outlook, the IEA's flagship publication series. Ms. Cozzi joined the IEA in 1999 as a junior analyst in the World Energy Outlook team. She has co-led many editions of the Outlook and led multiple special reports. Prior to joining the IEA, Ms. Cozzi worked for the Italian energy company ENI, and she holds a master's degree in environmental engineering from Polytechnic Milan, and a master's degree in energy and environmental economics from any corporate university. Laura, welcome very much. We're excited to have you at GTC this year. Thank you so much, Josh. It's really my pleasure and the IEA pleasure to be here with you today. So let's start maybe by just talking about the IEA. Can you tell us a little bit about why the IEA, an organization focused on energy, is looking so closely at the issue of AI, data centers, and energy? Yeah, absolutely. So Josh, maybe let me start by telling your audience what is the International Energy Agency. So we turned 50 last year. We are an organization that was founded in 1974, immediately after the wake of the oil crisis. So since then, we have been working with our member countries to ensure secure sustainable supply of energies. So this is our core mandate, and our member countries are really around the globe. The United States is one of our members, but its membership is larger. Canada, Mexico, European countries, but also Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, etc. So last year, I think I witnessed a very interesting phenomenon. Basically, every energy conference we were going at, the main topic was artificial intelligence. And in a way that basically, artificial intelligence was going to reshape the entire energy landscape. And I have to say that we have basically one very core principle at the International Energy Agency, we are a data-driven organization. So we started digging into data, because this is what we do is our bread and butter on a daily life, we dig into data. And quite frankly, immediately, we understood that there was a data gap out there. So we spent the past year or so really working with a lot of the companies with NVIDIA being one of those to try to dig further and understand and try to answer the questions that are in everyone's minds in the energy industry. And the questions are the following. How much energy is AI using today? How much energy will AI use in the future? And how can we, in the energy sector, use AI applications? So this is why we came to look into the AI so closely. Thank you. And I really appreciate the comment that you made about the IEA being so data-driven. That's definitely something that I think we all see reflected in your analysis. I know myself and my colleagues follow your work very closely. And we're very glad that the IEA is bringing its rigorous analysis to this important topic. I think some of our watchers and listeners may know that this topic is also highly visible these days, the topic of AI and energy. There are a lot of studies and headlines that seem perhaps inconsistent. So maybe a good place to start as we get into the substance here is to think about the context of data centers in the energy industry. Can you help us frame how data centers fit within the global energy system? What are the recent trends in electricity consumption in data centers? And how is AI perhaps changing those trends? Yeah. So I think, Josh, I would like to maybe kick off with a very important point you mentioned just now, the uncertainty. So I think when we started looking into this, the estimates out there that show how much AI and data centers are using today, not even for the future, is a large factor of uncertainty. It's about a factor two, which in the energy sector is pretty unusual, I have to say. But then we really started gathering information and try to understand. So maybe we start putting things in context. And if you don't look at the entire energy sector, because basically AI, what AI needs is fundamentally electricity, the global electricity sector today is around 26,000 terawatt hours. So we are with you, NVIDIA, today. And if you look at all the shipments you had last year for the H-100 chips, all of those, if they were installed and used last year, they would have consumed around 8 terawatt hours. So this puts a bit in the context how much we're talking about. So our best estimate today of how much electricity the entire data center are using is around 1.5% of the global energy sector. So one might think, OK, this is very small. And it's true, at the global level, this is very, very small. So there are two elements that are important, however, to disclaim the small at the global level. First, at local level, data centers may be extremely significant. So we are seeing that with the changing chips, basically electricity use for data centers is becoming more and more dense. So it can consume a mid-sized data center, can consume a small city of around 100,000 people. So one data center can change the electricity landscape in a single geographic location. So this is important, especially because it's coming in electricity systems that in many cases are already congested. So this is one element. There is another element. When we look at overall data, if you look very broadly over the past decade, electricity demand in most advanced economies has been very flat and stagnating. But what we have been actually seeing in recent data is that you see an uptick in electricity trends, especially in the United States, where investment in data centers has been growing at two digits. So if I summarize what we are seeing is the following. First, there is no hype at global level. The global level numbers are still quite small. However, this is growing very fast. It's probably one of the fastest growing areas in the energy sector. And locally in specific locations is it matters hugely because it's like adding basically a small town. So this is a bit where the situation is today. Thank you. Yeah, those numbers are really interesting. I'm doing a little quick math in my head here. You mentioned, you know, the chips that Nvidia shipped last year, the H100s would consume around eight terawatt hours. And overall global electricity consumption is around 26,000. So I think that means 0.3% of the total electricity consumption is what, you know, last year's shipments would have been. So it's impressive, but it's still, as you mentioned, a tiny fraction so far of the overall energy consumption. One other thing I wanted to follow up on, you mentioned kind of the geographic constraints and the impacts there. Do you see any trends where these new modern AI data centers, which are less geographically constrained and tied to kind of the Internet locations, do you see any kind of broader dispersion of those data centers because they don't have the same latency requirements as traditional data centers? Yeah, I think that there are two different trends that we are seeing at the same time, that accelerated computing is more energy dense. So it would increase electricity demand. However, in electricity systems today, the flexibility matter as much as the electricity used. So the fact that you are able to actually have flexible loads is helping very much congested grids and grids in which we have flexibility both on the demand and on the supply side. So one second on this, on the supply side, as we are integrating more and more variable renewables, of course, we are having variability on the supply side. On the demand side, we are adding variable loads that may be electric vehicles that may be cooling when it's hot, that may be heat pumps in winter. So having flexibility that helps the system match supply and demand at every given point in time is extremely helpful. And we're certainly seeing this trend with these new, more modern chips. So we are actually able to have more flexible, more flexible loads. That means it's moved geographically where the inference is happening and when the learning for the model is happening. So certainly the trends is absolutely in that direction of increasing flexibility that actually may help grids and loads. Thank you. Yes. I know our CEO Jensen likes to talk about how if you have energy at a location, it's perhaps one of the most efficient ways to use it is to convert it to tokens and then into intelligence. It's much easier than perhaps trying to transmit the energy from where it's being generated to where it needs to be used. Yeah. You mentioned accelerated computing, which I think is fantastic. This is, you know, of course, the platform on which we're building AI. And it really is a key enabler of AI development and deployment. We've seen exceptional advancements in energy efficiency in both accelerated computing and in AI. How do you see the role of those energy efficiency trends affecting the energy footprint of data centers? So, Josh, I have to say that there are two areas that I find on one hand extremely fascinating. And for a person that is used in energy sector with numbers that are that is not the usual ones. Right. So just again, let me start with the global energy sector. If you look at how much efficiency for the overall energy system improved last year globally, it improved one percent. When we have started studying how much from 2016 to 2024 GPU efficiency was growing year on year. It's 50 percent. So it's a completely different scale from what you see, not only in the global energy system, but there is nothing else in the energy sector today that has the ability to scale energy efficiency so quickly. We had one calculation made last year when we actually started presenting this topic to our board, which I find really illuminating in a way. So if you were to take today the largest AI model, I will not mention it, but you're all using it. So it used 20 with 24 zeros calculations to be trained. So it's a huge, very, very impressive number. And we calculated that if this model was trained with a supercomputer and the technology we had 20 years ago, it would have used the electricity that China is consuming today. The overall China today would have just been used to train the large AI model 20 years ago. In reality, the calculation that we have done and we know how much electricity was used is around the electricity used to power Paris. So we have gone a completely different scale. So what's happening in terms of efficiency is just astounding and really something that we are not used in the energy sector per se. I really appreciate that example. It gives you some some sense of these huge numbers and the rapid, rapid evolution in energy efficiency. I know last year when we talked about our new Blackwell platform and compared it to Hopper. So just in one generation for inference for AI inference, Jensen announced it was 25 times more energy efficient. So it's a 96% reduction in energy in just one generation, which is it's hard to to kind of wrap your head around that. So I think your example of China and Paris is really, really poignant. Speaking of these variables that can potentially have really dramatic impacts on projections and modeling. What variables perhaps in addition to energy efficiency does the IEA see as the most impactful? Maybe variables that others are not fully incorporated into their studies to ensure that your projections are as robust as possible. So I would maybe divide this in four different items and let's take the energy efficiency aside in a way we have tackled it. I would say that this is really incredibly, hugely important because it's something that is so fast, it is so not average for the energy world that for us, this is an area where absolutely working with companies like Nvidia and really the IT sector is absolutely, absolutely essential. But there is another aspect that for energy experts, this is not the area of expertise of what we follow on a daily basis is really the demand for AI going forward. So how much is this demand evolving and therefore what does it mean for the demand of the deployment of data center going forward? So the activity, first of all, and again, therefore, it's absolutely essential that we could work very closely with the IT sector to understand the evolution. The third element that we're seeing being extremely important is the type of chips. And that's why we value so much the collaboration with you, because on the one hand, chips are becoming extremely efficient, but at the same time, supercomputing and accelerated computing is changing the way energy is used. So even if today we have 5% more or less of supercomputing chips in the stock today, they already account for around 25% of the overall energy use. So understanding how this will evolve going forward will actually determine the ultimate demand of energy. So there are three elements and you will understand very clearly that we as energy experts are not necessarily the best place. And that's why I come to the fourth point for us really working together and improving the data is going to be central. Ultimately, as our executive director mentioned very recently at the AI summit that President Macron and President Modi called here in Paris a couple of weeks ago, ultimately what we are saying is very simple. There is no AI without energy. So what we need to do is really working all together to make sure that the energy sector understands in a sensible and realistic manner how much energy is needed to fuel this AI growth. So having a better understanding of the data today of the chips, the energy use for data center of the efficiency of the cooling requirements, etc. will be absolutely, absolutely fundamental to understand the future. If you don't know what is the energy use today, we cannot speculate about the future. So a lot of our work has been really to work with all of you to understand the beginning and how the outlook may evolve. Thank you, Laura. That all makes a lot of sense. And I think the point you made about how critical energy is for AI is really, I think, what's driving a lot of the interest in this topic, AI and energy. I'm curious, does the IEA view kind of that type of signaling where you're doing the analysis and trying to help perhaps policymakers, perhaps organizations and others understand what the near term requirements are in order to achieve this dream of fully implementing AI? Do you view that as the IEA as being one of your key goals and your projections and your analysis these days? I think, first of all, we want to bring clarity because there's been a lot of confusion and sometimes confusion as brought to weariness and sometimes weariness can lead to slowing down something that instead needs to be accelerated. So what we have seen is very clear in certain regions of the world, data centers are already today representing a significant share of the load. And in some cases, it has created difficulties on a grid that was already congested. Now, I think those examples may have created worries, more generic worries that in some cases are not substantiated. So what we want to be bringing at the table is something that is more specific, that goes into the details of which regions of the world may be experiencing issues and what type of issues and what will be the solutions. So it's really bringing fact based analysis to make sure that the AI sector receives all the energy it needs and that the energy sector continues to evolve in a way that the energy is given to citizens, to the entire economy in a sustainable, affordable and secure manner. Yeah, it really does help to bring data to cut through the noise. And as somebody who's in the sustainability space, I'm really optimistic about the potential of AI to help us solve big sustainability challenges like climate change. So I appreciate the kind of the orientation that you have around. Let's let's make sure that the data we have is accurate. And so we're not unintentionally putting up roadblocks that aren't necessary if we really want to take advantage of the potential of AI, not just for economic development and and so forth, but also for something a lot of us care about, which is fundamental sustainability challenges. So we talked about variables just now and the types of variables that IEA is thinking about as you're modeling energy and electricity. Can you share some thoughts taking those variables into account on projected pathways for data center electricity demand over the next decade? So we've been doing quite a lot of work on this, George, and you are aware of it. And I will anticipate something, but not too much because we have a major report coming up on the 10th of April. And I hope that many of you will be following the launch on that that very on that very day. But there are certain things that are very clear that are that are emerging already already now. First of all, under all the type of cases that we have that we have analyzed, in fact, maybe the first thing I should be saying is that we will not be showing only one scenario and one projections because the uncertainty is so large that it would not be serious to go out and say we are certain that AI will use this much in 2030 or 2035. There is uncertainty already for the next two or three years and more you go further in time, the more uncertainty grows. So what we have been trying to do is highlight what are the type of futures that we may imagine and how the for AI and how this may impact the electricity and energy and energy sector. And what we find is the following in all of the scenarios. Electricity use for AI is growing and is growing strongly. On this, again, there are two important differentiation. The first is growing strongly, however, is still going to remain a relatively small part of the global electricity system. And in some regions, in some locations, we will need to work in a smart way between the IT and the energy sector to ensure that the energy is supplied in a timely manner. So I would say that those are the first findings and maybe I will add another one as our executive director in a way already unveiled it. We have been looking at basically all data set centers pipeline around the world and at the same time analyzed each of the regional grid in a very granular way with the pipeline of plants and congestion of grid existing today. So in a base case, we would be warning that around 20% of the current data center pipeline may witness delay if something is not done. However, we are confident that there are actions that can be taken to make sure the toll of the pipeline will be actually seeing the light of the day. So we will be going into much greater detail to explain what type of things the energy sector can do and the IT sector can do. Excellent. Yeah, it sounds like there's there may be some practical guidance in there to help us figure out how to how to move forward in this area of change and flux. And I think, yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to to your report. Like I said, we always appreciate the IEA is very thoughtful work, so I think I'm sure it will be influential once once you publish. Thank you. So we've talked about kind of the importance of trying to model energy use and electricity consumption for data centers as accurately as possible to inform policy. Right. And perhaps development of energy resources. What do you see as some of the biggest challenges that we face in addressing the growing electricity footprint of A.I. and data centers? I think what we have done so far, again, with all the data we have seen, is very clear that there is not a problem of scale, but there is a problem of speed to industries that are not necessarily moving at the same pace. And for me, what's a very clear example is the following. If you look how long it takes to build a data center, you're talking about something that is in the order of a couple of years. And now the most important piece of the various energy sector that matters for the A.I. development are grids. And grids currently take between six and ten years to be developed, extended, modernized. So there is a mismatch. There is a sector that is going very fast and another sector that is going a bit slower. So I think all the attentions need to be focused on making sure that the two are more and more aligned. Now, the grid sector in particular is experiencing difficulties. I will not go into very technical things, but there are parts that are essential parts of the electricity grids like transformers, where the shipment time has grown significantly. We are waiting four years for the transformers where prices have gone up. So again, there is not a matter of being able to produce the electricity that is needed. It's really we need to make sure that the grids are able to transmit it to the data centers that need it. So a time alignment and sequencing is going to be hugely, hugely important. That makes sense. I know from your previous analysis that the IEA has published, that as you're modeling future load growth, you see other sectors potentially having a larger aggregate load growth than data centers. I'm curious if you see any distinction in the challenges that you're mentioning around grid and transmission and so forth. Do you see any differences in how those challenges might affect AI and data centers versus electrification and transportation and manufacturing, other sectors that are potentially growing? Will those challenges affect all of those equally or do you see any differences between? So I think that the fact that AI tends to be more concentrated than, for example, so let me start with the following. You are completely right. There are other parts of the energy sector that are going faster, especially for what concerns electricity. Globally, the largest incremental load that is coming going forward is actually cooling needs in the emerging world. But here you will be talking about air conditioning that is distributed across, say, the Indian subcontinent. So it's going to be much more distributed than a specific AI data center. This is why I think the very geographically important grid investment or upgrades will be much more important for AI than more distributed as modern load that will come over time. So I think that the difference is the concentration and the speed that we are seeing more than, again, the magnitude of the amount of electricity that will be needed. This would be the immediate thoughts that comes on this. Great. Thank you. So we talked at the beginning about how the IEA is publishing data and trying to bring data to this broad conversation about data centers and energy, which really ends up being a cross stakeholder function and service. How can you how do you see different stakeholders, including governments, international institutions, industry players, research institutions? How can we all collaborate to promote efficient grid friendly data centers? So, Josh, I think that this for me was was very illuminating. We had the pleasure to have you here back in December when we hosted, I think, one of these, I believe, probably one of the largest first gathering of the IT sector, energy sector industries and government. And for me, what if I have to bring back a couple of lessons from that was that currently the discussion is happening, but it's not yet at the level it should be. And there is not enough information to have a very constructive discussion. So I think that absolutely we need to open exchanges and discuss more and more. And we have identified a few of the areas that for us are are the most important ones. First of all, we mentioned this already several times, that data on current energy use for AI and data center is absolutely essential for everything. It's going to be the core and the basis of every conversation that is not based on feelings, but on facts and that can bring the conversation forward in a very, very healthy and constructive manner. For the electricity sector, I would say that beyond AI, but AI in certain sectors is accelerating this need. There is an absolute urgent need to speed up a permitting of grid up rates, grid developments and building new stuff. So this is something that we were already discussing for the energy sector, but the AI is really accelerating this need. And a conversation between the two sectors, I think will help the energy sector to move forward more quickly. The third part, I think you mentioned this in the way you formulated the question, that there are smarter ways to incorporate AI and data centers within the energy sector. I think you mentioned this in the way you mentioned this in the way you mentioned this earlier, the flexibility element that data center may bring into the equation is one that is incredibly important that can actually help the electricity sector. So the location and the location matters, but matters in two ways, it matters for the electricity sector. But if there is a way for the electricity sector to signal to the AI sector that actually, if you really need to build something, maybe here is not the best place, but there is another location where it would work. It's great. So it's a conversation that can work both ways from the AI sector offering and being very clear about the flexibility needs and for the electricity sector to indicate where there would be places that would actually welcome this load. So I want to highlight maybe a couple of other areas where I think there is a convergence probably of emerging challenges where that will be faced at the same time for the IT sector and the energy sector is critical minerals. We are seeing that for the energy transition and the electrification of the energy sector, critical minerals are becoming incredibly important, but it's the same for the AI and digitalization. So I would see this is an area where the two industries and governments in the center can actually help ensuring that the minerals are there for the sector to ensure a smooth transition. And the other area with the critical minerals, I would like to mention one in particular, which is copper. We are really seeing some mismatch of copper demand and supply currently. I think if both the electricity sector and the AI sector are vocal about it, I think this could actually be sped up. So there are, I think really, really area of convergence and cooperation that could help both sectors to move forward more quickly. Thank you. Yeah. And I think the conference that the IEA held, as you mentioned in December and the AI Action Summit recently as well, those are great opportunities where this cross pollination, sharing of data and so forth is really helpful because it's so complex. You know, you talk about copper, you talk about projections for demand, all of these areas. It's it's there's so many variables at play here. It's really critical that we're all sharing data so that we can have the most accurate projections possible. Yeah. So we've talked about AI and I've hinted at kind of my perspective that I think AI will really help us solve some of our biggest sustainability challenges once we really deploy it for that purpose. I'm curious about how you see the role of AI evolving in the future of the energy sector, especially in terms of sustainability. Where do you think we're going? How will they impact things, perhaps positively or negatively in the energy sector? And Josh, let me thank you very, very much for all the conversation so far, but particularly for this question, because I think that up to now the conversation between the energy and AI sector have been very unidirectional, but it really should be bidirectional. A lot of the conversation is about how much energy is needed for AI and very little discussion is actually happening about how can AI help the energy sector in solving all the issues, including the sustainability one. I personally am incredibly fascinating and I see huge amount of opportunities for AI applications for the energy sector. And I have to say that in the past, first in the meeting, the December meeting, and then in the months after that, really see and talking to companies, there is a mushrooming of ideas and things that can really actually help advancing sustainability. So let me start being much more concrete. First of all, we are going to be releasing an energy and AI observatory at the IEA will be hosted in the IEA website soon. And we absolutely want to tackle the two things. So being clear about the data. So we will have all the data that we know about being there and available by regions, by sectors, so that people understand better. But importantly, we will be storing AI cases, uses in the different parts of the energy sector. Hopefully, this will pollinate ideas across the energy sector and speed up some of those quite exciting applications that we are hearing. Let me mention one. We have been talking about grids and electricity quite a bit up until now. And we have heard from one company, one specific application that started integrating weather data, real time sensor and applying those technologies. The grid congestion has been reduced dramatically up to 60%, which basically means that you could actually open up more opportunities and availability for more electricity to flow and actually serve more loads. If you look at what the in the way AI and companies are actually purchasing their electricity today, they are one of the largest purchases of renewables. So they're actually being the largest PPA purchases for renewables. So they are a driving first force within sustainability itself. And they have brought to the table back some nuclear and importantly, a very important conversation on small modular reactors. So very directly supporting the deployment of cleaner technologies. But in all this, what I find the most fascinating, and I think we are just at the beginning of that, is really the more innovative part, the frontier part. When we hear the way AI is revolutionized proteins and the way we think about some things in medicine, it is just incredible. And I don't think that this has happened yet in the energy sector. So just maybe conclude with one small example. We have seen recently solar that is based on siliceum spreading everywhere, but there has been a lot of discussion on new modular technologies for solar. One of these is called perovskite. And up to now, there are really around 1000 perovskites that have been experimented and developed globally. But the potential number of untapped perovskites is around 10 million. So really here is where I would see AI could really help accelerate the innovation process. And solar is one example, but batteries, battery chemistries is another example. Use of digital twins that can accelerate demonstration to market. So it's really this area that personally excites me the most. And that would drive, as you said, Josh, really the sustainability in a much more quicker way. Yeah, there are so many potential moonshots, including battery chemistry and carbon capture and storage and other things where AI has huge potential. We need some time to see which of those will come through and which ones won't. But it's very exciting to think about those huge possibilities in the near term. You know, a couple of use cases I've seen with the energy sector in AI. We've seen partners at like Crusoe where they're locating AI data centers where there's excess energy already. Yeah. Specifically soak up those extra electrons and other partners like Eco Data Center in Sweden, where they're using renewable energy to power their data centers and then they're recycling all the heat from the GPUs to heat local homes. It's really. And again, you have this complex web of how energy and AI are engaging with each other. Yeah. One final question for you. Do you. We've talked about kind of AI in the energy sector and that impact. If you think about how AI is being deployed in other sectors, say, for example, in manufacturing or in transportation or in buildings, do you see any potential there for AI to have an impact on those energy loads, perhaps by driving more efficiency or better use of existing energy resources? Does AI aid in any work in that area? So we have actually started doing a lot of work on these across sectors. So we looked at transport, we looked at buildings, we're looking at industries. And again, on 10th of April, we actually have estimates of potential reduction in energy use depending on the amount of AI uptake. And I have to say that the numbers are really, really interesting and impressive in a way that the potential for AI to reduce those loads and move them towards the more sustainable path are really, really large. So very, very exciting. Perfect. I'm definitely looking forward to that study. Well, thank you very much for your time today, Laura. This has been fascinating. I think a lot of our partners will be interested in what you've had to say. I just wanted to give you a chance if you have any final comments before we sign off. So thank you, Josh, first of all, for inviting us. And really the invitation is that to work more closely together, the IT and the energy sector. I think in this way going forward, we'll make sure that AI is thriving and we move forward toward a more sustainable world. So thank you for having us with you today. Thank you for all the collaboration up to now. Thank you. Entirely our pleasure and we look forward to more collaboration. Thank you, Josh. Thank you, Josh. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Josh.
