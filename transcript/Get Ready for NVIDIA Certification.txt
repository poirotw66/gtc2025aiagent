 Hey, let's get started. I'm coming out of this day again. I work on this whole film. This show really starts with big Annette Thank you. Hello, everyone. My name is Juan Durillo. I am Principal Instructor for the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, and I welcome you to this session, Get NVIDIA AI Certified within UTC 2025. Let me start highlighting first the importance of certifications. Certifications are an important access in your career development. They help you validate your skills and your abilities. They demonstrate your knowledge for performing a specific class. In your CV, they are much more impactful than simply claiming you have expertise at one or another topic. Certifications also signal your commitment to career developing and continuous learning. They give you a competitive advantage. Many times, certifications can be also the open door to, for example, new roles or new positions. They can be the stepping stone to advancing in your career, getting a new position and a new role within your company. We know that certifications sometimes also entail some financial costs, but in the long and medium term, the benefits of certifications really outweighs by far this financial cost. I have lots of good news for you today. At the end of this presentation, we will be sharing with you in the Q&A session one promo code that you could use during GTC to get a discount in any of the certifications that we have. Now that we understand the general importance on certifications, I'm going to be telling you the topics which I'm going to be covering in this session today. First, I'm going to be giving an overview of the NVIDIA certification program. After that, I would like to talk about the different certifications that we have on NVIDIA at the moment, intended for AI developers and intended for professional of infrastructures. I would like to finish presenting the roadmatch of certifications, telling you which certifications are already live, which you can take already the exam. And at the end or any time during the presentation, if you have any question, please post your question on the Q&A box. Let me start with the NVIDIA certification program and give you an overview. As any certification program, the NVIDIA certification program is intended to validate your skills and abilities. And they intended to do this in the context of the AI industry. Today, I'm going to be covering the different certifications that we have. I'm going to be covering the highlights in the contents, the kind of roles that are a good fit for each of the certifications. I'm going to be talking a little bit about exams and how to prepare for those certifications with different courses that we have also available at NVIDIA. In the left side of the slides, you see the different roles or stakeholders who might find important certifications. I'm going to be trying to cover for what those roles might find those certifications important. For example, individuals. Certifications are important to demonstrate your abilities and your skills. And as commented before, they will give you a competitive advantage in the market. For companies. A company that has a lot of certified employees normally has a competitive advantage in the marketplace. The NVIDIA partners can use, for example, the NVIDIA certifications in order to upskill the workforce and have access to this competitive advantage. For recruiters, certifications may be one way in order to understand whether a candidate applying for a position has or not the skills needed. And the other way around, if you are a person applying for a position, NVIDIA certification can signal the recruiter that you are a good fit for that role. For students, the process of studying all the material, going thoroughly over all the concepts that we have for preparing a certification and preparing for the exam or even taking the exam, help you to understand better the K concepts. They also help you sometimes to master some technologies and many times also to become early adopters for new technologies. All those things together put you in a really good position in a very competitive job market. And as commented before, they also signal your commitment to continuous learning and continuous developing in your career. On the right side hand of the slide, I have an overview of the different certifications that I am covering during this session. Before jumping into describing each of those certifications individually, I would like to highlight a couple of things in the end of the day. One thing that you can see if you look, pay attention to the right hand side of the slide is that we have certifications covering different levels of expertise. I'm going to be starting with the bottom level. And this is the associate level certification. The associate level certification is an entry point certification intended for developers, researchers, people who have been in the industry for less than a couple of years and who are starting to become experts on a field and master in NVIDIA technologies for that field. In the middle ground, we have the professional certifications. Those certifications are intended to validate the skills of professionals that have been already for like two, three years in the industry and they know how to work with the media technologies for that field. Finally, there will be a third level of certifications, which is the expert level. This is intended for professionals who have been in the industry longer time and they master completely. One thing that I would like to comment also at this point is that the media certifications have a validity period of two years. This means that once you get certified, you get a certification available for two years. This is a common practice in industry. And the idea is like your skills and your abilities should always take care of the state of the art. This is especially important in a quickly development field like, for example, this AI. After the two years have passed by, you can get recertified and the only thing you will have to do is to retake the exam. Obviously, the new exam will have questions reflecting the new developments in the field. Talking about the exam, I would like to give you a little bit of an overview of how those exams are prepared. First of all, so we perform a study of the job market and we analyze what are the tasks that the people we intend to certify are doing on a daily basis. Once we understand those tasks, we get in contact with subject matter experts or SMEs. They help us to create a blueprint with the contents and the weight of each of those contents that will help validating that people have the knowledge for performing those tasks. The blueprint is then shared with all the SMEs that are collecting and creating questions for evaluating that knowledge. The questions are shared and reviewed by different SMEs with the goal that we have a curated set of questions that are appropriate. There is no bias within the questions and there is no line as well. Once we have a curated set of questions, we create beta exams which are shared with SMEs as well as other partners and collaborators. And out of these beta exams, we create new exams that are the ones that people who intend to get certified can access to. Once you pass one of the exams, you will get a credential by NVIDIA indicating that you are certified for a given topic or that you have a given certification. In addition, we will also provide digital budgets that you can share in your social networks or in any digital asset that you have. With this all of the way, I'm going to be now focusing on the different certifications in the people. I'm going to be trying to highlight the level they are intended for. I'm also going to be highlighting the kind of things that they certify, the content that is needed on how to prepare for those certifications. I'm going to be starting with the generative AI certifications. Those certifications are intended for the AI developers and they are at the moment too in the associate level. We have the generative AI certification with LLMs and the generative AI certification with multi-models. I'm going to be now jumping into highlighting the importance of each certification, which kind of knowledge, what things they intend to certify. So let's start with the generative AI for LLMs. This is a certification that intends to validate that you have foundational concepts for developing, integrating and maintaining AI applications, working with generative AI and specifically with LLMs. As said, this is an entry level, it's associate level and is intended for different roles. For example, AI developers, any kind of applied scientists, applied data researchers, software developers and any kind of person who has some basic understanding of AI and language models can access to this certification. The exam should be completed in one hour. It's multiple choices. You have around 50 to 60 questions and it can be taken remotely. Here on the right side of the slide, I have an overview of the contents that are part of this exam. So, for example, as part of this exam, we have to show knowledge on ML and AI. We have a large part on experimentation in software development on through Swarfi AI and also on data visualization and data preparation. Let's look with a little bit more detail to those topics and let's pay attention to the exam blueprint for this certification. For example, in terms of core ML and AI knowledge, what this certification is intended to elevate is whether you have knowledge on algorithms and techniques that will help you learn out of data. So, learn machines, learn out of data and make predictions. That you have the knowledge to clean data, transform data or simply get useful inside information out of raw data that can be later on useful for any kind of decision making process. That you understand how to evaluate a machine learning model and how to interpret the results of a machine learning model. That you have some software development skills in order to create or test software architecture space in any of the models that we are working with. And that you have an understanding of what is ethical AI. That you have an understanding of energy conscious AI as well as reliable AI. Okay, I get another question you might be getting is how do I prepare in order to get that certification? Well, in the first place, there is a study guide that you can download from our website. If you go to the section training and within that section to the subsection certification, you will find the study guide for this certification. It contains different topics and materials you can review. And it contains a series of courses from the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute that will help you preparing for that certification. In this slide, I have or we have a table with a curated set of materials from the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute or in short, DLI that will help you to prepare for that certification. In total, we are collecting 40 hours of training that we recommend to prepare for that exam. We have two modalities. Instructor-led workshops where you will have a person who is teaching the course live that will help you if you get a stack, if you have an issue. If you don't understand any of the topics, the instructor will help you to solve those things. If you are interested in this kind of courses, please get to our website, get in touch with us because there are different modalities you can get access to those. For example, you can purchase one of those workshops and have it delivered to your company or purchase one of those workshops and come to NVIDIA and we will deliver it up for you. In addition, we have normally a schedule of public offerings of those workshops on different regions that you can check on our website. Again, go to NVIDIA training section and there go to certifications and check what we have in the planning and the schedule for the next month on the different groups. The courses that we recommend for preparing those certifications if you are interested in instructor-led are the fundamental software learning, fundamental software data science, building transformer based natural language processing applications, rapid application development with NLMs, as well as building AI applications with brand engineering. If you cannot attend instructor-led workshops, you don't have the time in order to attend these live sessions. And self-paced is more your modality. You want to have videos with the content and then the courses at your own pace. We also have self-paced courses. For each of the instructor networks that I was commanded before, there is a self-paced alternative that you can encode. Now moving to the next certification. This is the Generative AI Multimodal Certification. It's also an associate level certification intended for AI developers. And the kind of knowledge that this certification tries to validate is whether you have foundational skills needed to implement, manage, develop AI systems based on your narrative AI and integrating different data modalities, like for example, text, audio, video, image. The format of the exam is very similar to the exam for the LLM certification. It's one hour, multiple choices. You will have between 50 and 60 questions and the exam can be taken online. The kind of audience we have in mind for this certification are, on the one hand, the same that were recommended for the LLM certification. But in addition, any person who has expertise with the innovative AI, developing applications with LLMs or their senior software engineers or senior researchers can also be a good fit for that certification. If we look at the contents that we have for the certification, one of the things that stands clearly is that there is a good overlap with the LLM certification. We have, again, core ML and AI, experimentation, software engineering, visualization, as well as working with data. But in addition to that, there is a strong focus on contents that relate to multi-modal data as well as optimizing models. Looking with a little bit more detail in the exam blueprint, we can have a look to what is the kind of knowledge that is intended or recommended in each of those contexts. For example, again, whether you have the knowledge of algorithms and techniques that makes computer line out of data and make predictions. You have knowledge on cleaning data and transforming data into valuable insights. You are able to evaluate and understand the results of a material model. You are also able to integrate different data modalities, being text, audio, video, data series. For example, geospatial data into models and address all the challenges related to missing information in any of those modalities. In terms of software development, whether you are able to design and integrate systems based, for example, on the unit architecture or working integrating CLIP into different models. In case of trust-based AI, whether you have knowledge of ethical AI, as well as energy-consumed AI and reliability AI. Another important content here will be the performance optimization of models. Whether you are able to optimize a model for a given criterion, for example, energy consumption, using techniques like transfer learning or hyperparameter optimization. For preparing for this exam, again, we have also a study guide that you can download for free from our website. And in this slide, again, we are presenting a curated set of courses from the NVIDIA BitLaning Institute that could help you preparing for that certification. Again, it's 40 hours and we have both modalities, the instructor-led workshops as well as the self-paced ones. You will see now that there is a strong focus on multimodality. So we have, again, the fundamentals of bit learning and the building and transforming based natural language processing applications. But in addition to those courses, we have building conversational AI, generative AI with diffusion models, and building AI and agentic applications for multimodals. Those are focused on having all the modalities, different aspects. For some of those courses, there are also self-paced versions of alternative. But for some of those, there are not. So if you are interested, please, again, check our website and check one of the schedule for delivering those workshops publicly or get in contact with us if you want to purchase the delivery of any of those workshops. Okay, I'm going to be now moving into another kind of certifications and they are intended for infrastructure. If you have any question, remember, you can post your question anytime on the Q&A box. So in this slide, I have the three certifications I want to focus on this session today. One of the things you could see is that there are three certifications. One of them is for the associate level and two of them are for the professional level. One possibility for understanding or interpreting this slide is like if you want to get the knowledge on infrastructure, if you want to get certified and getting all the knowledge and abilities and infrastructure, you can start, for example, with the associate certification and then move all the way up to getting a professional certification. However, this is not necessarily a requirement. If you are a professional who has been already in the field for a couple of years and you have enough knowledge of infrastructure, you can jump directly into any of the professional certifications that we have. Now, I'm going to be start to commenting the different certifications individually, highlighting what are the contents and how to prepare for those certifications. First, I'm going to be starting with the entry level point, which is also an associate level certification called AI infrastructure and operation certification. This certification validates whether you have the fundamental concepts of AI computing related to infrastructure and operations. The audience is, as you can imagine in this case, the business side of the infrastructure. We're talking here about, for example, the engineers, developers who are working on the data center, system architects, solution architects, sites representative, and any kind of roles of people who are working in the infrastructure and operation side. The exam is very similar to the two associate level exams commented before for AI developers. It is one hour. You can take the exam online. There will be around 50 to 60 questions, multiple choices. And as before, I commented for all the certifications, the certification is valid for two years. On the right hand side of the slides, you have a list of the topics that are part of the certification, as well as the weight of each of the topics. In this case, we have AI operation, AI infrastructure and core AI knowledge. If we look into the blueprint for this exam. So this is the kind of knowledge that you are required to have. For example, you have a basic understanding of deep learning, machine learning and artificial intelligence. You also have a basic understanding of NVIDIA software or NVIDIA solutions for AI. You know how to monitor using a data center. You know how to create a virtualized infrastructure within the data center. You know your way with technologies like, for example, learn and Kubernetes orchestrating the workload of your data center. You know how to scale a GPU infrastructure. You also know the differences between on premise versus cloud. And you know, for example, how to have the networking part of your infrastructure more or less under control. In order to prepare for the certification, there is also a study you can download from our website. Additionally, if you go to our website, you will find a list of topics that will help you prepare for the certification. On top of that, there is a self-paced courses that we recommend for the certification. It's about seven hours can be complete online. And this is the AI infrastructure and operation from the method course. For many times, you will also have discounts when you're registered for this course. So please check online and register for that one. If you want to prepare for the infrastructure and operations certifications. Okay, now I am moving to the professional certifications. I'm going to be talking about the first professional level certification of this session. This certification is the AI infrastructure certification. It's a professional level that validates the candidate's ability to manage and maintain AI infrastructures powered by NVIDIA technologies. The audience that we have here, data center admins, dev-op engineers, machine learning operation engineers, any kind of software network administrator, storage administrator, or solution architect might be a good fit for this certification. Now, I want to comment a couple of things that are completely different from the associate level certifications that we have seen so far in this presentation. First, it's about the price. The price of this exam is higher than from the associate level. The good news, as I commented at the very beginning of this talk, is that during the ETC, we are offering a promo code. You can get some discount when registering for any of the certifications of this exam. An exam of the certification, sorry. The second difference is about the exam format. In this case, the exam will contain a higher number of questions. We will have between 65 and 17 questions for the exam. The exam will have a duration of two hours instead of an hour. And although it can be taken online remotely from your computer, there will be a person who is watching you via the webcam while you are taking the exam. If we look at the list of contents for the certification, we also start also seeing differences with regards to all the contents that the associate level certification have. For example, here we are requiring you to have a good knowledge of the physical layer and management. We will require you to have a good knowledge of system and servers, network, and troubleshooting. If we look to the exam blueprint, we can get a more detailed overview of the kind of knowledge that we are requiring for this certification. For example, whether you know how to install, remove, or modify the GPU drivers. Whether you know how to make a GPU work within a bucket container. Whether you have an understanding of the media GPU cloud, in short, NDC, and how to configure the client tools in order to access from a given machine in your infrastructure to that cloud. Whether you know about power and coding infrastructure, you know how to install GPU physical servers, GPU servers, and you also know about the network. For example, you have an understanding of things like the topology that your infrastructure should have, as well as know your way with MVLink, MVSwitch, and hardware solutions like, for example, InfiniBand or networks. And in case of troubleshooting, we want you to show knowledge on, for example, what will happen with faulty cards or optimize, for example, the storage solution that you have for your infrastructure, according to your workload. In order to prepare for this certification, we have again a recommendation of courses for you here in two modalities, self-paced and instructor-led. In this case, there is no one being alternative to the other, but the recommendation is to take those two courses. In total, we have around 35 hours of training. The first one is the fundamental course commented before about operation and infrastructure. So, at pace, you take it online and it's about seven hours. The second course that we recommend for this certification is the AI infrastructure professional workshop. This is a workshop that's going to be taught online by the instructor over multiple days, five to six days, and you're going to be covering cutting edge NVIDIA technologies, as well as tools intended for you to manage and install an infrastructure with NVIDIA technologies. Finally, I'm moving to the last professional certification that I'm going to do today. This is a certification that validates the ability of candidates to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize AI infrastructures with NVIDIA technologies for giving AI warnings. The kind of roles that we had in mind for the certifications are machine learning operation engineers, DevOps engineers, solution architects, any kind of system architect, or any kind of infrastructure architect. The exam format is very similar to the other professional certification commented before. So, again, two hours, there will be around 65 to 70 questions. While you can take the exam online, there will be a person who is watching you while you're doing the exam via the webcam. So, the knowledge that we require for the certifications are also a little bit different than before. Let's focus on the exam blueprint for this. So, we have a big block on administration of systems. We want to know that you are able to administrate clusters of SLAM. You have an understanding of VCM technologies. You also have an understanding of multiple instances of use, MIG for AI as well as HPC workloads. You also know your way into workload management systems, like for example, FLAM and Kubernetes. You understand about installation on deployments of, for example, VCM, Kubernetes, NVIDIA GPU Cloud. You know how to install and download containers from there. You also know how to download virtual machine images and put it into production. You understand what are the infrastructure requirements for running your AI workloads. You also know how to deploy Docker systems for deep use, etc. And there is a big block here related to troubleshoot things. You are able to troubleshoot problems related to Docker. You are able to troubleshoot problems related to the infrastructure network with InfiniVent and MP-Link and MP-Switches. You know how to troubleshoot problems related to VCM. And you basically know how to troubleshoot anything that repeats on the data center impacting the AI workload that is running. For preparing for this certification, again, we recommend two courses. The first one is the same for all the infrastructure role certifications. This is the fundamental self-paced course for infrastructure and operations that you can take online. And we also recommend an instructor-led workshop course. In this case, this is the AI operation professional workshops. Again, this is instructor-led. It takes place online over multiple days. And you will learn besides cutting edge technologies of NVIDIA for monitoring workloads, how to learn about tools for, for example, deploying or orchestrating AI workloads in your data center or infrastructure. Okay, now I'm going to be focusing into commenting the roadmap that we have for certifications. I will tell you what it's already available for you to take the exam and what it's coming soon for you. And you can enroll for those as soon as they are available. So in this slide, I have the roadmap of certifications we have at the moment. As you can see with the green color, we have highlights of certifications that are already live, for which you can register and take the exam immediately. Remember that we have shared with you in the Q&A the promo code, and you can get a 50% discount for any of the exams of any of those certifications. In this slide, you can also see that the certifications are divided into different groups. If you look at the top level of the slide, you will see the professional level certifications. And on the bottom side of the slide, you will see the associate level certifications. If you look at the left side, you will see all the certifications that are related to the infrastructure. And on the right side, you will find all the certifications that are for AI developers. As you can see, all the certifications commented during the sessions are already online. So you can take the exam for those. And a couple of good news is like, coming soon, we will have a new professional certification for AI infrastructure. This is the AI networking certification. And if we look at the developer side of FEMS, soon we will have one professional certification, which is the accelerated data science certification. Also coming soon, professional level for developers, we will have the OpenUSD for 3D workflow certification. Well, with this, I'm finishing the talk during the session. Again, we're going to still ask answering questions on the Q&A box. And I hope you got a clear understanding of the landscape of certifications we have at NVIDIA. And I thank you for your attention. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
