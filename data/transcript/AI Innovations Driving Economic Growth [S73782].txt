 Hi I'm Hungcentury Alex Project F minority MAC Lovely The Tarte Back Attack Pixel Thank you. Hi, everyone. Welcome to GTC 2025. We're super excited to be here with you guys with some distinguished guests, where we'll be talking about AI innovations driving economic growth across different emerging markets. Today on this call, we have Marwa, we have Fred, Philip and Andrew, and they'll all introduce themselves and the fantastic work that they're doing. But prior to that, in this conversation today, you'll learn a little bit more about the work that they're doing in healthcare, education, talent development, and how they're driving innovation in Africa and beyond. So I'll hand over the mic to Marwa to introduce herself. And then from there, we'll go to Fred, we'll go to Philip, and none the least, Andrew. So over to you, Marwa. Hi, Fatima. Hi, everyone. It's a pleasure to be part of this fantastic panel. I'm Marwa, Program Manager at Innovation City, where I oversee the implementation of unique and innovative innovation programs like incubation and acceleration programs. Our programs are focused on artificial intelligence as well as industry 4.0 and sustainability. And I look forward to adding insights into this panel. Thank you. Thank you so much. Over to you, Fred. Hi, everyone. Fred Swaniker here. I am the founder of Sand Technologies. So the way to think about Sand is that we solve complex problems at scale for cities, states, and governments around the world, as well as large private sector companies. So think of us like a volunteer, except we don't do defense and CIA work. We use AI and data and digital twins to solve big problems that are meaningful in society and that are peaceful. So that's what we do. Prior to starting Sand, I launched something called the African Leadership Group, which is training hundreds of thousands of people in Africa and data science and other technologies and leadership skills and so forth. So that's my background. Thank you so much. Over to you, Philip. Thanks so much, Fatima. And thanks, everybody. Name is Ambassador Philip Thigo. I'm the Special Envoy for Technology for His Excellence the President. Of Kenya, my work basically is the first digital ambassador for Africa. So I have a lot of responsibilities around ensuring that the continent has a fair share of technology, but also engages in a more meaningful way. I really work very hard to ensure that Africa is not left behind and not just Kenya, especially in this conventional and critical and emerging technologies. Thank you. Thank you so much, Philip. Over to you, Andrew. I'm Andrew Sweet. I'm the Vice President for Innovation at the Rockefeller Foundation, and I oversee a somewhat new portfolio called AI Partnerships and Strategy, where we're supporting entrepreneurs around the world in areas from education, healthcare and agriculture to improve development outcomes in Africa and Asia, Latin America and Caribbean. Wonderful. Thank you, everyone. So currently, what are the work that you guys are doing to change that in your fields? So we'll start with Marwa, we'll do Fred, Philip, and then Andrew, and that will be the circle that we will go through for the rest of the questions. So over to you, Marwa. Thank you, Fatima. So in Tunisia, we are supporting AI startups so they can develop their AI technology and also protect their respective sectors. And so we are involved in many AI projects, innovative AI projects that we support startups. In Tunisia, particularly, we notice that startups, they develop AI technology, especially in the field of agriculture. And so we support startups. They're leveraging AI, whether it's in agriculture, healthcare, or other fields. And our support really spans from mentorship, providing resources like cloud compute resources, and also exposure to opportunities like access to partnerships with NVIDIA and other prominent innovative companies to help them scale and expand their activities on a local and on a global perspective. Awesome. Thank you so much. And I think it's also important to know that Tunisia last year became one of the first countries in Africa to acquire a DGX. And by acquiring a DGX, a lot of the partners that Marwa work with were able to get access to compute, which tends to be one of the biggest bottlenecks on the continent. But over to you, Fred. Thank you, Fatima. So we are involved in a few projects that are really looking at how do you leverage AI to solve big problems, like in healthcare and to close the digital divide and for education and so forth. So, for example, one of the big challenges facing Africa is that you don't have enough doctors. So when you look at a rural area, in the U.S., the typical doctor-to-patient ratio is 300 patients to a doctor. In Africa, it's 8,000 patients to a doctor. In South Sudan, it's 66,000 patients to a doctor. So we've built a system called the Rural Health Operating System, where we're using SpaceX satellite to connect rural clinics with high-speed bandwidth. And then with that, we're able to put AI-enabled devices in the clinics and then also sensors and other things. And we're able to then augment healthcare professionals like nurses and community healthcare workers with AI-enabled devices and intelligence to do more sophisticated work like what traditionally have been done by a doctor. And the real problem with that is that once you've connected the clinics and you have these augmented healthcare professionals, where then all the data analytics stuff comes into a national health intelligence center so that the people who run the system, whether it's the minister or the planners, can actually see real-time what's going on in the system. How many babies were born yesterday? What is the disease burden by district? You can start to see early signs of a pandemic and so forth. So it shifts the healthcare system from being reactive and expensive to much more predictive and preventative and really allows leaders to have the insight to be able to make decisions, know how to allocate resources and so forth. So that's an example of something they're doing. And then finally, we're also building skills. So last year, we enrolled 670,000 people in our training programs in data science, software engineering, AI, and so forth, and graduated 200,000 of them and created 10,000 tech startups, many of them who are using AI. So we're building the human capacity to be able to deliver AI solutions to the continent as well. Fantastic. Over to you, Philip. Thanks so much, Ashman. Great to hear. Marwan, intern in Tunis. I didn't even know that. Actually, I started my early years in Tunisia, so I speak the language. I think for me, and this is what I've realized, is that there are great innovators like Fred and Marwan, who are doing a lot of work on the ground. But then you realize that you can easily be disrupted by global big tech companies because we know technology exists between a few companies and a few countries. So my role has traditionally been to ensure that at least at the policy level, that work, for example, like what Marwan and Fred does, is actually anchored on a policy framework. So one of the things that I worked on very closely with the U.S. government was to push through a U.N. resolution on safe, secure, inclusive, and trusted AI for sustainable development. Because either then you risk a race to the bottom. So that was very important to the extent that now you had six months later, $100 million by all the big tech companies put to bear for startups. You know compute is expensive, yes, to access it, but also it's expensive to use it. The other part, of course, is what I do is you're kind of building an engine as you fly, right? So the other part is to ensure that policymakers do not stifle innovation. So how do we ensure that policymakers do not rush to create legislation that stops, for example, work that a lot of our innovators do because dairy is sensitive, compute is expensive, talent is inaccessible, but also where are these use cases and how do you amplify them? So part of my work has also been to surface a lot of these use cases in front of policymakers so that they understand that you need to adopt a very agile way so that you do not stifle innovation. So that's kind of part of the pieces I've been doing, whether it's in agriculture to ensure that AI can drive incomes to farmers' pockets, whether it's to work with people like Jacaranda Health to ensure that they can scale a work that they're doing around mothers and pregnant mothers, whether it's to work with the big tech companies around flood mitigation. And so those are some of the things that we've been working on. Of course, finally, issues around safety. So Kenya is the only country that is part of the inaugural network of AI safety institutes to ensure that the models actually speak local languages. So how do we ensure that you have linguistic diversity for African languages so that the models, as much as they're fine-tuned and trained, are not unsafe when they're translated? In our languages. Over to you, Andrew. Yeah, thanks, Patum. I was going to give a broader overview of Rockefeller, but maybe I can do that later, because I think it's more important to pick up on kind of what Ambassador Thigo was talking about and a little bit of what Fred was talking about as well on the importance of AI and healthcare. And Kenya is a really important partner of ours. Our regional office is based in Nairobi, and we've always found the country to be a source of innovation with a deep base of entrepreneurs and developers, but also policymakers that are invested and really get it. And so maybe I'll start with an example from Kenya and in global health and this issue of preventing maternal mortality, which is a challenge around the world. But it's also a particular challenge in Kenya where you have about 7,500 mothers that die each year, and about 90% of those deaths are preventable. And so we have been actually working with the organization that Philip mentioned with Jacaranda Health, and they have a couple of years ago, they put together Prompts, which is kind of an AI help desk for pregnant mothers. It gives them increased confidence in their mother journey. And so they can ask Prompts questions from, can I eat avocados while I'm pregnant to my baby isn't moving? Is that a problem? And so they've been able to automate this help desk. And so about 86% of the responses to the mothers are automated, but the others are flagged. And for trained clinicians who are on duty 24-7, and they respond within a minute. And so this is a really exciting innovation, but particularly for women in rural areas that don't have access to local clinics. And one of the things that we're helping Jacaranda to pilot in Kenya is kind of a nudge system when they can send messages to pregnant mothers in advance. And so this is particularly important with extreme weather events, letting mothers know if a heat wave is about to happen and what they can do to protect themselves. But it's really important that it's not just some rogue operation that an NGO is doing, that they're connected and they're, you know, responsive and take the lead from the government. And so they've been working on over a thousand public health clinics in over 20 counties throughout Kenya. And it's also exciting that it's been developed and managed by Kenyan engineers. It's not, you know, a handful of guys from Silicon Valley that have been plopped into Nairobi to use. This is Kenyan-led, which is something that we're particularly excited about. And it's already being used by 3 million people. It's been zero-rated for the mothers thanks to some really innovative partnerships with African companies and a little bit of philanthropy. And it's already handling 10,000 questions a day. There's some early evidence about how effective this intervention is. It's already led to a 20% increase in prenatal care visits and a 10% increase in family planning visits. So we're excited about this. I think other countries are excited about this and learn in applying. So one of the other things we're helping to do is to scale to Nigeria, to Kano State, and also to Ghana, because they see the innovation that's happening in Kenya as well. Awesome. Thank you so much for all the insights. Super interesting. And I think one of the things that we see in the AI ecosystem is there is a silo, right? So there's a lot of work that's happening on the continent, but a lot of people aren't able to, like, connect the missing pieces. When the fintech revolution happened in 2012, up until, like, the 2019, the 2022 phases, we saw a lot of exits. We saw unicorns. We saw a lot of publications around fintech. What do we believe is the missing ingredients when it comes to artificial intelligence? Because Fred mentioned a lot of the work that he's doing with talent. Marwa mentioned the work that she's doing with providing compute access to researchers, to startups. Andrew, you touched on the work that you do with Jacaranda Health. And Philip, you also spoke about bubbling up use cases to policymakers. But at the end of the day, there seems to be a disconnect somewhere. What do we think is missing and how do we think we can solve that issue? So, again, we'll start with Marwa, Fred, Andrew, and then Philip. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Fatima, for the different insights. So, it's important that the efforts that we do, either on a local level or a global level, have the, I would say, the spotlight it needs so that we can leverage more of the, I would say, networking or posturing synergy between the different actors that are mobilizing different resources or different ways to advance the ecosystem. So, I would say, building synergies between the different ecosystem builders in Africa and also putting more visibility and, I would say, collaboration between these different parties. Thank you so much for that answer, Marwa. Over to you, Fred. What do you think the ecosystem can do to make sure that collaboration is a lot more succinct and there's more visibility around the different projects and initiatives coming out of the continent? Well, I think the first thing that's missing is leadership, right? Like, so much in Africa and not ends with leadership. So, if I look at, for example, Rwanda, President Kagame has personally taken leadership and he's driving several initiatives. He's hosting the AI, the Global AI Summit, you know, in Africa. We've worked with his government in many initiatives where they are prioritizing using AI to solve problems in health and education and infrastructure and planning and so forth. So, leadership is where it starts and stops. And that's why, you know, some of the work that Philip is doing with AU is so important. The second is skills, right? We need data scientists. We need AI engineers. We need to be able to build our own applications and solve these problems. And the third, I would say, is success stories, right? People need to know and celebrate and see the impact of it so that it's not just something theoretical and that's only done in the West. But people can see that solving real problems for everyday people in Africa and improving the quality of life. The final thing I'll say is I think it's important as well that we start really with the problems that need to be solved and not the technology. And I think very often too much of the conversation on AI is about the technology. What is the latest language models? How many billions of parameters are being used to train it? How many tokens is the model using? Versus starting with the problems that it's solving and realizing that AI has been around for 40 years. It's much more than generative AI. And there's a lot of other artificial intelligence that is not necessarily compute intensive and so forth that can solve really meaningful problems. And that, I think, will really start to catalyze impacts on the continent. Thank you so much, Fred. That's a super succinct answer. Over to you, Andrew. Yeah, I mean, I think what Fred's already obviously was kind of very succinct and comprehensive. And I think maybe I'll just mention the piece that one of the pieces he didn't mention is this issue of compute. And given that we're at a NVIDIA conference, I think it's probably worth a brief discussion. And I think in Africa, a lot of work has been done. A lot of great work has been done by the private sector, by groups like Cassava and Mickwood to build data centers and to really get the fiber up and running around the continent. But there's still an issue on access to compute. That is an issue. I think there's obviously a finite amount of compute that's out there. Demand is greater than supply. And too often, countries and companies in low and middle income countries don't have access to compute that they need. I saw a report from the UN that only 5% of the continent's talent has access to compute. And so how can we change that dynamic? And I know this is an issue for people like Philip. I saw Brad Smith was with President Ramboza, I think, earlier this week. And the message from African leaders, as Philip mentioned, is that they don't want to be left out. And it's also a growth opportunity for a continent of 1.5 billion people that's going to double by 2070. We really need to think about where the innovation, where the jobs are coming from. And that's why work that Fred is doing at Sand is so important. Building the skills, building the companies that are based on the continent to solve these problems is so critical. And then maybe the final thing I'll say is this issue around data sovereignty. It's kind of a buzz phrase that's thrown out there. But I think countries are increasingly clear that they want to own their own data. And if they don't own their compute, then that's actually impossible. And this gets increasingly important for sensitive data flows around health information, around financial flows. And so owning your own compute and being able to decide how you want to use your information and that it stays within your country, I think, is going to be really important. Some of the work that NVIDIA has done with Indonesia and Sahaba is going to be really important. And I think that that's an innovation that other countries around the world are going to replicate in the years to come. Awesome. Thank you so much, Andrew, for that overview. And, Philip, you know, tying to what Fred mentioned when it comes to leadership and success stories, given that you work with a lot of leaders, be it the AU or in Kenya, and Andrew also mentioned compute, what role do you think the government plays in providing compute or facilitating infrastructure and data centers being set up? I think it really depends, right? And I wanted to come back to that. I know Fred spoke about leadership, but I think from where I sit, I mean, my president has been leading in this. We just signed something with G42, I think, a year ago around compute. And so I think government basically sets the trend, right, especially in this new infrastructure where you require almost a public-private partnership because no one government can do this alone. But then beyond leadership, I think for me it's about capacity. Do our leaders, do our countries understand this new infrastructure and how you invest, how you reposition, but also capacity for the financial institutions that exist, including our development banks? I mean, I've been having this conversation with all of these folks, and what I realize is capacity is a problem. And I'm not going to talk about capacity of data scientists and machine learning experts because, let's be honest, AI is not an ICT issue. It's a whole-of-society issue. We all have to recalibrate on how we embrace and engage AI, especially in solving the problems with health, agriculture. And so that's one thing that I spend a little bit of time speaking to our leaders. The second thing, of course, is tied to capacity is rules change, right? So this technology doesn't, as much as Fred has been around for 50 years, it's been accelerating in the last fall, right? So that in itself creates a challenge and stresses on our policymaking, our leaders think around investment. So how do we also ensure that our leaders can understand this kind of new mobility of AI and technology? The pattern, of course, is, and you cannot forget this, and because you're talking about Africa, is we're already living within a seriously fiscally constrained space. How do we ensure that? When you talk about compute, right, so you hear $500 billion signed between OpenAI, SoftBank, and the U.S. government. You had Macron and UAE signed something around $10 billion. Where is any African country going to find this? And so I think there has to be a reality check here to the extent that we engage in a conversation, and that is why I'm having a conversation with NVIDIA and Cassava, to the extent that we can engage in a public-private partnership that enables access to computer, building this infrastructure the same way Marwan can then have access to. So beyond leaders, you need leadership across, you need capacity across the entire value chain if we are to engage in this ecosystem, but also in a way that we're not left behind. That's super comprehensive. And Marwa, so Tunisia is home to Africa's largest tech exit, right? I think when most people think about big exits on the continent, they typically think Nigerian Vintech. But the reality is InstaDeep was acquired for close to $700 million, larger than DeepMind at the time. Tunisia also accounts almost 20% of its GDP is tied to consulting when it comes to IT services. It's a small country, but extremely mighty. Philip, if you spend some time there, you also know that when it comes to STEM, it's definitely a leader. There are more PhD holders that are women than anywhere else in the world than Tunisia. So curious to know, what do you think makes this market so unique? And why do you think it is isolated from the rest of the continent? Because a lot of people have no idea what's going on in Tunisia. Just last week, for example, we had a Tunisian university reach out to us trying to acquire hardware. So a lot of Tunisian universities are really leading when it comes to research and development. But when it comes to talent in sub-Saharan Africa, at least, it's not something that people are thinking about. And Fred, I'd be curious to hear your mind and thoughts on it as well, as someone who works closely with talent, if you look into Tunisia. So over to you, Marwa, first and then Fred. Thank you, Fatima. First of all, thank you for promoting Tunisia so well and for giving it a positive shout out here on this panel. And it's true, Tunisia has been gaining a positive momentum in the past few years, especially with Sadiq's exit. This has, I would say, sparked a lot of interest from the region, but also sparked inspiration for young talent and young entrepreneurs who also wish to follow in the same footsteps. There are many other factors, actually, that are supporting this wave or this momentum. So, for example, since Andrew spoke a lot about cloud compute resources, as you mentioned, Innovation City invested in cloud compute resources to enable researchers and startups. And so these resources enable startups and researchers to train their AI models, to develop their AI models and create an impact on the different industries. We have other things in Tunisia happening, especially with the different ecosystem builders, supporting startups. We have a governmental or I would say a national framework to support the Tunisian startup ecosystem. And, of course, talent. Talent is very important, which supports the dynamic ecosystem. With talent development, there is a growing talent in AI in Tunisia. And with Innovation City, we try to support this through our program, the AI Academy, which provides, I would say, developers and students with massive AI training, with NVIDIA certifications. So we're very proud to be supporting with NVIDIA DLI to be able to provide this massive AI training in Tunisia to enable this innovation wave. We're very, how do I say this? We're very optimistic about collaborating with other African countries this year or in the next year so that we can enable this momentum, not just on a local level, but also on a pan-African level, on an African level regionally. So within our scope at Innovation City, we are very looking forward to collaborating with different ecosystem builders in Africa so that we can duplicate, I would say, what we're trying to do in Tunisia and other African countries. Super, super helpful. And just to kind of elaborate on the work that Innovation City is doing, they tend to have every single quarter workshops where it's eight hours. They bring people in from all regions in the country, and then they train them on artificial intelligence. And most importantly, they provide them with access to compute so people can actually learn. And, you know, moving on to Fred. Fred, you mentioned earlier before success stories. And I think when a lot of people think about leaderships in Africa and when they think about success, ALU and Ashesi, which is also founded by a fellow Ghanaian, Patrick Ewa, tends to come up. What do you think, you know, what is the ingredients to building leaders? And how has that inspired your journey into sound technologies? Well, sound technologies is really born out of a realization that in this 21st century, leaders need a new competence. And I think COVID really showed the world that as a leader, technology was no longer the stuff that, you know, was about fixing the printer and the email. Right. Most leaders before thought of our tech as that. And then during COVID, you suddenly had to, as a government, deliver, you know, services to all your citizens remotely. If you're running a factory, you had to learn how to automate and run it without, you know, being able to go there and so forth. And so it suddenly put technology front and center. It became a new competence of leadership. Right. And of course, then the other thing that has really shown that this is something that is central to leadership is the AI revolution more recently with generative AI, which has really taken AI from this thing that was in the obscure research labs to something that even your grandmother can see the potential. Right. So what we are doing is African leadership academy has always been about developing leaders, African leadership academy, African leadership university and ALX. So even as we went into training technology talent, we said, let's first start with developing them as leaders. So people go through six to eight months of leadership training before they learn data science and software engineering, cloud computing, because it's also very important. If you're going to give someone a tool as powerful as AI, if it's not infused with the right ethics and values, it can be dangerous for the world. So it's important to start with that ethical foundation and leadership and then also to expose people to the problems of the world, health care, education, climate change, infrastructure, you know, urbanization. So that when now you learn artificial intelligence, you have a purpose. I want to build AI for health. I want to build AI for education. You're not just coding for coding sake. So that's the way in which we're developing this talent. And through that large pool of talent that we're now building, we're also capitalizing on the fact that Africa's got the youngest workforce in the world. You know, by 2050, we're going to have 60% of the world's youth. So how do we leverage this talent to build AI workforce of the future, not just for Africa, but for the world? So what SAN Technologies is doing is we're harnessing the youthful potential of the continent, building a large AI workforce and using it to solve problems in Africa, but also to solve problems in the world. So our AI systems are managing the water supply for the city of London, right? We're helping large American telecommunications firms figure out where to roll out fiber in the USA, right? Using NVIDIA chips. And, you know, we're solving problems in insurance companies in Australia and New Zealand and so forth with African talent, including some from Tunisia. We have a PhD, you know, a woman who is part of our team, a data scientist, building some of these algorithms, right? So that's sort of what has really happened from going from developing leaders to developing, you know, tech leaders who understand technology and now leveraging that talent pool to solve problems in Africa and around the world. And that's what SAN Technology is doing. Thank you so much, Fred, for the insights and the context. I've had the pleasure of visiting one of the universities in Mauritius and I've, you know, dealt with a few folks from ALU and, you know, outstanding leaders that are, you know, graduated from that establishment. Over to you, Andrew. I'm a fan of a lot of the work you guys do at Rockefeller Foundation, especially curious about the global initiatives that you're working on. So beyond Africa, what are the things that you think the world can learn from Africa and African can learn from the other regions that you manage? Yeah. Thanks, Fatima. I think for us, you know, it's as Fred mentioned earlier, artificial intelligence isn't new. And we came to the game 70 years ago when the academic named John McCarthy sent us a proposal. And in that proposal, he used the term artificial intelligence for the very first time. And we funded the first ever 1956 Summer Conference on Artificial Intelligence. And so a lot of what we're trying to do is to live up to a legacy and to make sure that, as Fred mentioned, you know, there are people that are developing these technologies with an ethical focus. And so building on that legacy, I think there's three main roles that we play. We play a facilitator role. We play a convener role. And we play a communicator role. And so on the facilitation, a lot of what we're trying to do is to think about the technologies that are being developed in Silicon Valley and other places and how they can be best applied around the world. And I want to kind of double down on Fred's point about focusing on the problem first and then the technology. And where we come at this is we have a global presence. You know, for better or worse, we've been in this game for 110 years. Our endowment is from oil and not from technology. So I think we kind of a neutral actor in this space. And so I'm constantly on the phone with our regional leaders in Bangkok and Nairobi and now in Colombia saying, hey, what are the challenges that you're facing? And then connecting them to some of our partners in San Francisco where I'm based. So that facilitator role, that problem solver, and then bringing technology to help solve those problems is an important role. Another thing that we have, for example, is a lot of partnerships with some of the tech companies. So, for example, we have a great partnership with OpenEye. We have a great partnership with Anthropic. Anthropic supporting one of our partners in Rwanda, Rising Academies, with kind of technical support. There started this teacher coach accelerator program that Rising Academies is now a part of. So really excited about that. The convener role is also something that we're excited about. You know, we have this beautiful facility in Lake Como in Italy. In October, we brought together some social sector leaders. We brought together some of the leading philanthropists around the world and a bunch of companies, including NVIDIA. Talk about what are the problems that we want to solve together and really getting concrete about how we can work together and address some of these issues, including compute. And I think there's some exciting outcomes of those conversations that we're tracking right now and hoping to sign. And then the third piece is on communication. We have to do a much better job about telling the impact that AI is already having and will likely have in the near future. And that's kind of plays through a strong suit as a neutral player. Like we don't need to be some by little optimistic techno optimist. I think we need to point out what are the opportunities, but also what are some of the challenges. And I think not enough is being done in this space. And so being able to tell the stories of, you know, sand, the stories of Jack Arena House, being able to tell the stories about how public sector leaders like Philip are driving the agenda, the work that's being done in Innovation City. Like that has to get out there. People have to understand it. And that's something that we're going to be focusing on going forward. Super, super interesting, especially the part around showcasing the success stories that are coming out from the continent because they are there, right? So it's just a matter of spotlighting them. And Philip, when it comes to you, earlier you mentioned a lot around bringing use cases to the government or to policymakers. What are some of the use cases that you see artificial intelligence addressing in Africa? Or what are some of the problems that you think it can address? Well, I mean, I've been, as I said, I've been fortunate to be on this road for a while. I was part of the UN AI advisory body on AI. And part of the work that I was doing around the body was to look at opportunities and enablers. Because sometimes we really talk about the problems, but we really don't talk about what artificial intelligence in these early stages can do. So I think the first thing, and interestingly, I'm looking at my chart right now, is thinking through how AI can begin to solve crisis, right? So we already, in Kenya, for example, last year, deployed collaboratively with all the big tech companies in the Red Cross, an AI model that we build with IBM and Benzahid University in UAE around responding to floods and landslides. And so for the first time, we had an alert system in Kenya that could broadcast to everybody, sort of to warn them around potential areas of landslides, but also floods. But also interesting enough, it was important to actually use geo-AI or geospatial data to be able to map terrains where then you could actually put camps that would not necessarily, again, be impacted by floods. So we see that, and that was done in four days, so you can imagine. So it's just not about the scale and scope, but also it's the speed that you can deploy these capabilities. Second one, of course, is around food systems. And we know the challenges in Africa, 60% or 65% roughly arable land. It's the continent, largely smallholder farmers. So issues around traceability. And that would ensure that smallholder farmers can actually produce in a way that then they can find markets and earn more money. So we've seen that in Kenya and a couple of countries in Africa. We've seen now farmers, for example, incomes go up by 150, 175%. It may not be a lot, but that's a huge deal for farmers. And again, deploying large-scale capabilities like this adds scale to smallholder farmers. The third part, of course, is, I mean, in government, right? So issues around public administration. We realize that Africa is still largely run by government. Unfortunately, we don't have private sector companies that can run public services. And so I think for us, it's been important to leverage an AI through platforms like Mera and WhatsApp, which is the biggest social media platform, to be able to use linguistic diversity of translations, to be able to engage communities who would hardly have had capability to speak. We are still an oral culture. So how do we still use voice and our languages to be able to amplify challenges, but also access to issues like health, which we have community health professionals now, things like public administration and government services. So I see those three big ones, if you ask me, as a big game changes. Public administration and ensuring services reach the last mile without necessarily being literate to access government services. Issues around food and food systems and food traceability and ensuring that food can be consumed in a way that does not create challenges. We are seeing, and I know, Andrew, your team has been working around increasing cancers and NCDs. And I think this is important, right? And so I think these are some of the big use cases we ask me, IC and climate. We still are the continent that is ravaged highly by climate. People talk about adaptation, but you'll adapt until when? So there has to be a way that then we can disrupt and use a whole portfolio approach to ensure that Africa can, yes, adapt smartly, but also can mitigate issues on climate action. Awesome. Thank you so much for that overview, Philip. And we've talked a lot about like what people have done in the past, what we're currently working on. And curious to know, like, what are the future initiatives on the continent that you're excited about or what future works are you doing? I'm happy to start. Like, NDABA is happening in September. NDABA is one of the leading research organizations and conferences that happens on the continent. They're going to be in their ninth year this year, and it's going to be in Rwanda. Last year it was in Senegal. The year before that, I think it was Ghana. And they've also done it in Tunisia. NDABA is super, super impressive because it's a group of researchers. And out of that, you've had startups that have been born. You've had interns that have been placed at the likes of DeepMinds and other big tech and local startups as well. So we'll start with Marwa. Is there anything that you're working on in the future that you're super excited about? Or is there any initiatives on the continent or outside the continent that, you know, sparks your curiosity or innovation? Thank you, Fatima. So drawing from our past, I would say, past experiences or achievements in Tunisia with Innovation City, I would say we really look forward to our upcoming activities in the region or on the continent. You know, with Innovation City last year and beginning of this year, we've trained 1,000, over 1,000 AI developers in just two quarters. And so in the future, we look forward to amping up this number or continuing to, continuing with this massive AI training so that we can achieve greater impact. This time around, we want to get other countries in Africa involved and not just on the Tunisian level. Last year, we've supported over 50 AI startups from Tunisia. And so in the future or current, present, up until the future, we look forward to continuing our work with early stage AI startups by giving them access to cloud compute resources through mentorship, through opportunities in the region. So we want to achieve that in Tunisia and also in the region. Another thing that we look forward to is to amplify our work, like I said, in Tunisia, but also on the continent through collaborations with other African ecosystem builders, with other African AI ecosystems. We want to amplify the impact on a continental level. So I think collaboration will help us achieve this. And we look forward to organizing a very high-level AI event in Tunisia by the end of this year by getting the ecosystem involved in Africa, where we can shed spotlight on startups, researchers, the entire AI ecosystem, and leveraging from the different expertise and the different achievements. And looking forward to more accomplishments on a continental level. Perfect. Thank you so much, Marwa. And I probably haven't told you guys this, but Saudi Arabia reached out to one of the universities, and they want to model a lot of the work that Tunisia has been doing, specifically Innovation City. So I think the work that you've done in the past and present is definitely setting future presidents for other stakeholders in Africa and the Middle East. How about you, Fred? What are you working on in the future that you're super excited about? Any upcoming initiatives? Well, in the short run, something that I'm excited about is, you know, next month, the Global AI Summit on Africa, which is going to bring so many of the world's leading minds to the continent to look at what we're doing in Africa, but also to, you know, share ideas and connect Africa into that global ecosystem. So hopefully that will catalyze some really interesting collaborations that will benefit the continent of Africa. And then in terms of what, you know, I hope to see evolve in the medium to long term, I'd say a few things. One is, I'm excited about the potential for AI to allow us to do more with much less. Right. Because I think ultimately, you know, when you have resource constraints, like we do in Africa, you have to innovate. I would say that constraints drives innovation. And so AI for me is an opportunity for us to improve the standards of living in Africa without necessarily increasing our GDP per capita. Because you can reduce the cost of delivering health and education and, you know, infrastructure and, you know, all those things that we value and we aspire to have a better life. The things that we're chasing the GDP per capita for is to have decent education and housing and all those things. So if we can deliver that to you within your $300 per year GDP per capita, then you are able to redefine and create wealth without necessarily increasing your GDP per capita because ultimately you're improving the standard of living of everyone. I think that's what we really need to get right in Africa. This is not about just building models and whatever. It's about solving real problems for society and reducing the cost of solving those problems so that it fits within the wealth that we have in Africa so that we can have the same. You can have a mother because you can live in New York City and $200,000 a year and not be able to afford good health care. You can live in New York City and make $300,000 and not have a good education. But with AI, you can deliver that at a fractional cost to someone in Africa who now earns much less. And that for me is what I'm reading. So I hope that the content can get and realize this potential. Otherwise, it will transform the content. Wonderful. I mean, you know, the key thing that you said, how constraints drive innovation. I think that's super exciting. And as mentioned, Indaba last year, a lot of their research was around how can they use less compute to drive more impact. So that's super interesting. And we're seeing that as a trend in the ecosystem in general. Andrew, over to you. What are you excited about moving forward into the future? Yeah. Yeah. A lot of what has been discussed really resonates with me. And I think a lot of what we're going to be focusing on going forward and starting this year is really thinking about getting rid of or how to address the inequalities and frankly, like the ego that is affiliated with artificial intelligence. And how can we bring together problem solvers that are solving similar problems on an equal platform where it's not like this is the person in Nairobi. Tell them how this problem is solved. And there's a model that we set up in December of 2023, actually with OpenAI, where we brought together 15 AI leads from cities from around the world. And OpenAI had a bunch of relationships in part because of Sam Altman's recent global trip. So they had Singapore, London, Paris. But, you know, we have all these relationships in Africa and Latin America and in Asia. So we brought Nairobi, Dakar, Lagos, Buenos Aires. And we talked about what are the problems that these cities face and how can artificial intelligence help solve them? So, yes, there were some presentations from open AI engineers about what are the technologies that are out there? What are the technologies that are in the pipeline? How can they be applied? But really what was exciting was to see those AI leads engage with one another without boundaries and without ego. And, you know, Singapore obviously had a lot to say, but so did Lagos and so did Dakar. And I think that type of equal playing field where people don't feel threatened, where there's kind of a closed door sharing of information and what works. I think that's going to be something that we focus on going forward. There's another initiative that's similar to that, that we're starting to talk about, about AI leads for governors in the United States. Everyone's kind of operating in their own space. They're in a bubble. They have challenges. They're excited. There's talent challenges that are happening in each of these states. But can we bring these, can we learn from the Nairobis and can we learn from the Dakars of the world and replicate that model in the United States? That's a really interesting problem. And I think it's something that will probably get involved in this year and going into coming years. Wonderful. Thank you so much for your insights, Andrew. Philip? This sort of potential around multimodal strategies, right, where the model can integrate text, audiovisual elements. And I think that's really where I think Africa begins to benefit from artificial intelligence, especially based on our historical disadvantages, whether it's literacy and all those. And we're seeing a lot in that space. So collaborating, of course, with people like Rockefeller, Mozilla, IBM. This is why I think it's our all-in effort. So I'm super excited that everybody wants to work together on that one. So that's going to be a big thing, especially around accommodating linguistic diversity. Because previously people were saying it's expensive to train AI on African languages. But now we see why you need to do it. The second part, of course, is what you're doing with NVIDIA around sovereign AI and ensuring that countries can share. Compute infrastructure can fix the issues of cross-border data flows, can actually share talent, but also think about agile legislation that ensures autonomy and security of their data or compute resources. Third thing, of course, is this resource element. I think I'm excited because of the African Development Bank annual meetings where we want to think about how to ensure that the bank can catalyze private sector resources, African resources, whether it's African middle class, but also pension funds. Because I think for far too long, a lot of these resources are being financed from externally and creating debt. I think the final one, and this is where my president did announce a trust summit. Because we all talk about safety, security, inclusivity, but we don't talk about trust. And I think AI in the African continent must be based on trust. And so we will be hosting a trust summit sometime this year, of course, as part of the AI safety network convenings to think about this very African concept around building public trust in the area of AI because of bias, misinformation, disinformation, and potentially the harms that AI can do to society. Thank you so much for the insights, Philip. It actually touches on my next question, right? So at NVIDIA, we work with more than 400 startups on the continent that specializes in artificial intelligence. Outside of compute, one of the biggest requests that we have is access to data on local languages. And inasmuch as we talk about artificial intelligence on this panel, the reality is majority of the continent doesn't only speak English and French, right? So what role does local languages and indigenous language or knowledge play in shaping AI developments? How do we make sure that we get everyone involved in developing solutions that are, frankly, mainly for them? So we'll start with Fred, Andrew, Philip, and then Marwa. So over to you, Fred. Well, I think that this is what's the really exciting thing about generative AI, right? I think, you know, the models that are being developed, fine-tuning them to African languages, African context, allows us to then solve so many challenges, especially in health and education, and also in the delivery of government services to citizens, right? If now you can converse in your local language as someone who is illiterate and get answers to your big problems, this is game-changing for Africa. If you can now bring a personalized tutor to every young person in Africa to help them, you know, develop their intellect, this is a game-changer. So I think that generative AI moment is really key, and it's drastically reducing the cost of, you know, translating the world's knowledge into African languages. And there's a friend of mine who works at Google, that Gen AI is almost like every single human being is being given an extra 30 basis points in IQ. So if we can imagine unleashing the power of what will be 40% of the world's population by giving them an extra 30 basis points in IQ, imagine what they can do. And that's really what I think, you know, creating our own versions of large language models has the potential to do for the continent. I think the Jack-Ren health actually is a really good example. They're proactively integrating new languages. They have four languages. They have Tui, Hausa, Swahili, and English, and they're trying to get more up and running. And I think that's a priority for them. I think we also should look at new languages as an economic opportunity. We have a partner in India called Karya, and that is what they do for a living. And they have partnerships with all the big tech companies, and they're able to pay their workers 20 times the minimum wage in India. And so it's not just, you know, yes, there is the kind of moral imperative to make sure that AI systems are inclusive. But there's also an economic opportunity, and I think Karya is a great example of that. We have another incredible partner with Digital Green. They've developed a multimodal to Philips Point chatbot called Farmer Chat. And so you can ask questions in voice. You can upload videos. You can get responses in so many different modes. And increasingly, they're available in different languages. So you can ask, you know, where can I buy the fertilizer that I need? And you can get responses immediately in the language that you speak. And I think we need to continue to think through what are the incentives to build more languages into these models and to make them inclusive around the world. And I think we're seeing this with some of the social sector organizations, with the jacarandas, with the digital grains, with the Karyas. But how can we do more? And then I think seeing that as an economic opportunity, but also seeing that as a way in which philanthropy can support this innovation. And that's what we're going to be looking at later this year. Wonderful. Unfortunately, we're almost at the end of this conversation. And it's been a really, really fulfilling one, right? So we've spoken about leadership and skill development and how it's integral into building artificial intelligence ecosystem. We've highlighted the fact that there needs to be more success stories that are, you know, brought to everybody's attention with regards to what's happening in Africa. We've also spoken about how constraints drive innovation. And curious to know, like, what's the last thing that you want to leave with the audience? Like, whether it's a misconception, whether it's an initiative that you want them to connect with. If you have, like, one last sentence to leave the audience, what would you like it to be? And also feel free to let us know how the audience can connect with you or any initiatives that you're driving. We'll start with Marwa, Andrew, Fred, and then we'll round up with Philip. So over to you, Marwa. Thank you, Fatima. And I'll try to make this quick. Well, I'm very, like I said, I'm very optimistic about what upcoming work we're going to do on a continent level with other African stakeholders and ecosystem builders. And I also just wanted to quickly mention a success story with one of our startups that is actually leveraging generative AI and local, incorporating local languages. The startup is called DeafSquare. And it's a career accelerator for deaf people, teaching them AI skills and different skills in sign language, but not just any sign language. It's a local sign language, Tunisian, sign language, or Emirati or Saudi, which is very powerful, enables communities, ensures inclusivity. And this is where I would say the local touch empowers communities. So thank you. We're obviously in a place of geopolitical uncertainty. There's a lot of shifts happening around the world. I spent five years of my career at USAID, which isn't the institution that it used to be. But so there's this move towards kind of self-reliance. And I think AI can help with that transition to self-reliance so that, as Fred said, every student can have a tutor. I think that that world is possible. And is there a way in which we could see these global shifts around uncertainty, around self-reliance, and help AI to power that moment? I think that's something that's top of mind and should be top of mind for all of us. So for me, it's really, again, let's start with the problems and not the technology. And finally, let's really think about AI as not a cost. Because very often they're talking about the cost of compute, the cost really as actually a way to do much, much more with much less resources. If we're able to really harness it properly. So it actually allows us to expand the impact of those few resources that we have. And that's the big opportunity for the world right now. Thanks so much. I mean, I think for me, and I really have to say this, is that I know this technology is exciting. So we shouldn't forget to invest in what matters. The continent is still not, people still don't have electricity. How do we ensure that we still do that work? How do we ensure that we unlock the potential for data? We still have data gaps, even for SDGs. We still have issues that are financing and resources. So this, I think for me, we shouldn't forget the basic foundation. We still don't have connectivity. Very, very few people still have access to the internet in the continent. And we still also have to navigate the kind of shutdowns and what happens in the continent. So I think as much as we are talking about AI and sort of the high excellence of technology, we still need to double down on these foundations if everybody in the continent will be part of this revolution. Awesome. Thank you guys so much for your time and for your insights. It's been super, super helpful. Asante Sana, Midasi, and Aishik for everyone's insights and time. We hope everyone enjoys the rest of GTC 2025. And yeah, you guys have added so much information that there isn't a paper on, right? So we really, really appreciate it. So from NVIDIA and everyone on the team here, thank you and enjoy the rest of your GTC. Thank you. Bye. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
