 Thank you. Thank you. Welcome, everyone. Today's GTC panel is on upskilling the AI workforce. My name is Karine Vardazarian, and I work at NVIDIA as a Senior Training Advisor. I also manage NVIDIA training in the EMEA region. Today, in our panel, we have four incredible speakers and panelists representing Cedaya, Deloitte, Chaos, and Gepheon. Together, they represent a blend of tech innovation, consultancy, national policy, and private sector dynamics. Each of our panelists brings their own unique perspective, and today we're going to explore how their organizations are adapting to the growing needs of AI talent and how they are overcoming the AI skills gap. Thanks for joining us. I will now briefly introduce each of our panelists. First, Dr. Mesna Almutairi is an AI consultant and leader of Generative AI Academy at Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority. Next, Mr. Tomer Gall is a Global CTO at NVIDIA Aliens at Deloitte. Welcome, Tomer. And Dan Ring, Senior ML Team Lead at Chaos. And Dr. Ulrich Nikolaus, Senior Director of Scientific Projects at Gepheon. Welcome, everybody. And we hope that you have a great panel discussion today. And please feel free to ask your questions in our chat box, and we will be trying to answer as many questions as possible during the panel. Now, let's dive into the conversation today, and I'm happy to start off with Tomer, with Deloitte today. AI is being implemented everywhere, but AI skills gap is a topic that has had a lot of attention recently. Deloitte works across so many industries. What common skills gap do you notice among your clients, Tomer? Okay, so I fully agree with the statement, and I think we all see this, given that AI, the innovations, the pace of it are so enormous. Plus, beyond that, when sometimes people ask you to predict a few years in advance, and then within a few months, there are new revolutions in AI. Who thought about it even? Yes, it shows even how predicting the sphere is challenging. So I fully agree about the fact that there is a big gap in the industry about it. Now, overall, if I look at the sort of gaps that we have, there are three kind of gaps. One is the technical gap, where, of course, you don't have enough skilled employees. This is number one. Number two, the ecosystem evolves so quickly. There are new technologies, new tools, new framework coming every few weeks, few months. So sometimes you need to learn from scratch. Okay, so no one has a background in this. So it's a lot of gaps. Even just absorbing what things does your organization needs to know. That's another gap. Okay, beyond that, so beyond the technical skills, there is the business skills, where the leaders, project managers, etc. So leaders need to see and understand if the organization goal, for example, is to make profit from selling products. So they need to understand where do we incorporate AI into our products? And how can we turn the revenue from this? What is the cost of AI, the infrastructure, etc.? And not to mention, of course, like I said, the aspect of project management. Not many are skilled yet with managing such projects, because when you manage something that you fully don't yet understand or know how to estimate or understand how it impacts your development, okay, that's also a challenge there. And the third skill, which is a good gap, is, okay, so you did the development, or you did your POC or MVP, now you need to integrate it. So this also poses a challenge, like, how does AI look when it is in production? What do you do when you have a bug and you need to improve something? What's your overall mechanisms? So these are overall the gaps that we see in the industry. Wow. Seems like a lot of gaps and multi-directional and also with the pace of the changing technologies. I understand that should be very challenging to keep up with technologies advancing and also upskilling the workforce and the talent you have both internally and externally. Maybe you could also share with us, Tomer, how is it different from one industry to the other? For example, finance, healthcare, or the different industries that you are working with, are you seeing any specific pronounced gaps in one sector that you don't see in the other? Are some advancing in the way through this upskilling path? Yes, true. So overall, there is the technical gap in there, meaning each kind of industry has its own technical skills that a developer needs to have. So this is one aspect of it. Another aspect of it might be the regulation or the impact of what happens when anything goes wrong. Plus, how do you evaluate these systems? How do you integrate something and not just have it as a black box? How much can you have it as much more explainable overall? So if we look across the industries, so in the aspect of finance, the knowledge that needs to have, for example, can be algorithmic trading. It can be the risk management. It can be fraud detection. Each one of them, you know, is a different set of skills. But that's OK, because also before, before AI, these skills were required. But anyway, now you need to do this using AI, using the specific neural networks, using what data sets you need to use. How do you evaluate it? And how do you continuously improve it? If we look at health care. So there can be many kinds of things within health care, whether it's robotics, whether it's the aspect of computer vision, et cetera. And there we have the aspect of the regulation. So I think it's a bigger challenge for companies that enter this for the first time. And not many, by the way, are just entering this for the first time, because in the aspect of computer vision, we had AI for many years already. So many companies, the state of the art algorithms of computer vision are already AI based. I think a bigger challenge is posed for those who enter the Gen AI, where now the users need to communicate with a large language model. That brings another aspect of it. If we look at manufacturing, so maybe you need to do predictive maintenance, quality control, supply chain optimization. And there is the aspect of the safety, of course. If I have some warehouse or a manufacturing plant, and now I'm adding robots, maybe I add even just the cameras for the computer vision. And the only goal is safety. I want to improve the safety. Okay. Not to mention the aspect of robots, which can cause harm if they malfunction or they don't keep working in their own perimeter. So there are many considerations here to take into account. I think when there is the regulation, it makes it more complex. And it's good that it's complex because all of us, when we go to any healthcare place, we want to have the confidence, yes, that we are treated by things that went through a very complex regulatory. Thank you. Thank you. Such a great insight. And we are eager to learn more as we progress towards our panel. We want to know more of how you are addressing these challenges and how do you help your clients also to address the challenges as this is manifold. And we will be eager to hear more from you. Thank you, Topper. Now, turning over to you, Mesna, maybe you could share with us about the Sedia's recent initiatives on the national level, training people on AI. And how do you address the AI skills gap at the national level? And maybe share with us what were the drivers for initiating such a large-scale project? Oh, hello, everybody. And it's a pleasure to be here with you, Karim, my fellow panelists. And I'm going to be very happy to share how Saudi Arabia, our AI skills development efforts and how we are building sustainable AI, our current pipeline through the Sedia initiatives. As part of the national strategy for data and AI, Sedia has taken on the ambitious goal for positioning Saudi Arabia among the top 15 AI leading nations. But beyond ranking, our focus is ensuring that we have a long-term, impactful, talented development. And there are exactly five major drivers behind Sedia's AI talent and development initiatives, each playing a crucial role in building a sustainable AI ecosystem inside Arabia. The first driver is the economic and the social transformation, where AI and data-driven technologies are central to achieve Saudi Arabia vision 2030 objectives, which goes around driving our economic representations and digital transformation and strengthening the national competitiveness for Saudis. The second driver was the workforce readiness, where the key target of the national strategy is to develop over 20,000 AI specialists and experts, ensuring that Saudi Arabia has a self-sustaining AI workforce. The third one is the global leadership in AI by investing in AI literacy and developing talented and helping it research. So Sedia is trying to shape Saudi Arabia as a global AI club, attracting the investment, fostering innovation, and positioning the pink nut as a leader. The fourth driver is the strategic sectorial impact, where we believe that AI is not just a technology, and rather it's a stormy force across many sectors. Having the right AI talent is crucial for driving the transformations in the standard radio priority sectors of education, healthcare, energy, government, and mobility are ensuring also achieving a sustainable impact. The last but not least driver is lawmaking and research excellence, where beyond the skills, Sedia is focusing on enabling the AI-friendly ecosystem through the policy research collaborations and robust AI governance framework that is sure responsible and effective. Wow. And could you please share a little bit about the challenges that you have faced as you have launched the initiative and as you're progressing with such a large-scale program nationwide, what are the challenges that you have faced and how have you overcome those challenges? While we have made strong progress, there are, as I mentioned, there are challenges, especially working at national scale, and we are still actively working on addressing these challenges. Maybe I'll name a few of it, which is keeping the peace with the rabbit AI advancement. So the AI field is evolved quickly. Technologies like large language models, AI-palm, and machine learning, it's required continuous updates in our training program to remain relevant. Also aligning the training with industrial needs. So initially, many AI programs focused on general AI literacy. Today, the industry demands specialized skills on specific areas, such as the applied AI, the computing, and AI governance. We have to bridge the gap. Bridging this gap is a key priority and a challenge. Engagement and motivation. So many professionals try to allocate time for AI training, especially when carrier-advanced and pathways. So we're trying to encourage lifelong AI learning, and intensive and structured carrier progression. Also, one of the challenges is the access to the AI infrastructure. So hands-on experiences is very crucial for effective AI learning. However, the access to a high-performance computing and AI startups and cloud-based lab remains a barrier for many organizations. And one of the biggest questions that still remains is, how do we really measure the success AI training? defining a clear return of investment metrics that reflect the workforce capability and the innovation outcomes is still a challenge that we are trying to live for. Wow. Yeah, I can resonate. Talking about different industries, different enterprises, these are similar challenges that they share, especially with the rapid change of technologies. And we can probably resonate also what Tom has shared about Deloitte and working with different industries. Thank you so much. And as I said, as we progress, we want to know more about how you have managed to overcome and what kind of effective tools you have used to encourage people to stay up to date with the rapid change of technologies and how do you help them to upskill. Now, maybe moving on, we can learn a little bit more about chaos. And my question is for you, Dan, when it comes to AI skills, what does chaos look for in the workforce? And how do you ensure you hire and retain the top talent? Firstly, hi, everyone. And Karine, great question. So at Chaos and my team, we're a product-driven research team. So this means that our AI effectively is largely highly applied. And that's the kind of perspective that I'll bring to all of this. So we're not a blue sky research group. We take cutting-edge research and turn it into real tools for artists. So it means we don't explore AI for the sake of it. We have to ship features and products that provide value. And I imagine that a lot of the audience here today will resonate with the audience. So this sort of product-driven mindset shapes the way that we hire and grow talent. So when it actually comes to hiring the AI talent, we obviously look for the usual skills like, you know, generative AI, diffusion models, convolution networks, transformers, LLMs, all the usual stuff. But we really want people to be able to think about AI in the context of building real products. Strong machine learning knowledge is obviously important, but it has to be paired with good engineering fundamentals. And we can't forget that. So the best ML engineers at Chaos don't just train models. They also understand systems deployment and optimization and all that other fun stuff. And as Mesna and Tomer had mentioned, this field is advancing incredibly fast. And what we really look for is somebody who doesn't just know about certain technologies or things, but they have the capability to learn. And I think that's, again, a kind of a strong thing that we look for. So balancing between applied knowledge and theory is obviously key. And in interviews, we assess practical skills using the usual things like coding tests, GitHub repositories and personal projects. But just as important is whether a candidate can explain a tricky ML concept like diffusion, like clearly and simply. So if they can break it down without jargon, it shows they truly understand it. So could they explain diffusion to your grandmother and have them understand it? I think that's kind of a litmus test for us. We also source candidates from all over. Online applications can obviously be overwhelming, as anybody who's had to hire from them knows. There's a fire hose of applications. And even with kind of being able to whittle it down with AI tools, it's really a battle for our internal recruiters. And the strongest candidates generally actually come from our own networks. So ex-colleagues, friends of friends, or particularly people within our own company. We also like to lean on our extended networks. So particularly academic connections to identify and nurture key talent. So one example is our Chaos Camp. So this is a program that we run with an external partner that takes about 30 or so undergrad students and then trains them in modules specifically valuable to Chaos. And then at the end, then those top students are offered roles within the company. So it's a lot of effort and a lot of work. But this kind of structured pipeline is one way that we ensure that we're building the talent that we need. But at the same time, we also know that great AI talent doesn't come from a traditional ML background. Some of our strongest AI engineers are actually engineers that started elsewhere in the company. So one of them actually came from a completely different team, but had a strong passion for AI. And then by giving traditional engineers room to explore AI challenges, we often find these sort of hidden people in our own organization. And they're wonderful. And you somehow need to fit them with the right training programs. And how do you decide what kind of programs? Because these people are coming from diverse backgrounds. As you said, one can have extensive background. The other is switching the specialization and training in AI. So what kind of how do you organize the internal training programs for them to be to retain in the company and in their roles? Yes. A great question. So we have we have a bunch of internal initiatives for training. So we use external partners like yourself. We've been delighted to work with you guys. And we do courses from all sorts of places from either like even simple things like YouTube channels and investment in time. We make sure that like leads on teams, you know, carve out the time for professional development. That's a really kind of core tenet for me as well. I want to make sure that I'm developing my talent, not just internally, but I feel like I need to develop them for their next role. That's like it's my responsibility to do that for the team. But we also do. But it's not just courses that they will take you so far. But hands down, everybody says the best way of learning is like on the job on a real applied project. So things like internal hackathons are wonderful, like by by by far one of the best initiatives. And we have two. And just to give kind of the audience a kind of a sense of what works and what doesn't. The we have two. One is a neurathon and one is a rendathon. The neurathon is primarily focused just on AI. It's engineers from everywhere using AI, different AI techniques to solve a single shared single problem. The rendathon is about solving lots of different problems, some of which could be solved using AI. And by doing it, by taking this kind of two pronged approach, it allows people to to mix and kind of cross pollinate a lot better. So you get people who are some people want to explore. Some people are very new in their AI journey. Some people are experienced and some people want to really dig in deep and dive into the data problems, dive into the computer problems and really turn up those electricity bills on the cloud computing. So I think those would be kind of the core ways that we kind of do a lot of training. But it's I mean, ultimately, it all comes down to doing work that actually matters. So people feeling that they've made an impact. And I think that's the kind of the in terms of retaining talent, as you mentioned earlier, that's the key motivator is like, are you working like engineers regularly say like, you know, am I working on a valuable thing? If I am, I'm going to stay. If I am, I'm going to stay. Great. Thank you for those great examples and insights, then I'm sure very helpful for the for the enterprise colleagues that are following us now over to you, Tomer. Could you please share with us about the Deloitte approach of upskilling its own stuff? Sure. So overall, the same things that we always do, you know, in the aspect of services and education for clients. So of course, the first thing we do is do it internally. We call this initiative usually Deloitte for Deloitte. Now, within Deloitte, for example, some of the things that we do is we train using the NVIDIA DLI courses, the Deep Learning Institute. Specifically, I have been an NVIDIA DLI lecturer, certified lecturer since 2018. I've been teaching many of the courses of CUDA Python, CUDA C++, Deep Learning for Computer Vision. And now there's all the aspect of the focus of the Gen.AI track. Now, the plus about the NVIDIA courses is that it's not just a collection of independent workshops. Some of them are independent, but for many, you have the flow, the curriculum of the entire path, for example, the Gen.AI path. Okay. So the NVIDIA DLI is one thing. Beyond that, we have something called DU. It's a Deloitte University. It's an actual facility, quite impressive, enormous facility, where usually we bring our own employees. Plus, we also bring clients. Everything depends on the content and the agenda. Beyond that, of course, we have the aspect of our AI Academy. It's tons of courses in the aspect of AI, Gen.AI, or overall even management. Yes, not only for AI. This platform is overall for us to learn and keep renovating ourselves. A crucial part, of course, I think for everyone, not just Deloitte, is continuous learning. How do we integrate learning into our flow of work? Meaning every day, all of us, yes. We have our day-to-day tasks. We have our projects. Maybe projects that we are about to get into. How do we integrate learning into our workflow? The scheduling of it, the agenda of it, the planning of it, not just being spontaneous. Yes, for all of the employees. Yes, we need to build a roadmap of the skills that they need to acquire. Plus, of course, specifically also when it's relevant to specific projects and specific clients and industries. Plus, I think it was already mentioned the aspect of the hackathons. So, hackathons can give employees the opportunity. For example, if some of them had less exposure now to AI, Gen.AI, so a hackathon can be a great opportunity to do this. If they choose the relevant project, they learn the relevant material to it, then they get to experiment with it hands-on. So, the value of hackathons are valuable, not just to the employees, also to the organization. Because I'm sure that all of us saw this across different companies, where some successful projects that eventually went into the product or even became a product, some of them were born in hackathons. The last thing is collaboration with universities. We have strong collaborations with universities, not just for the aspect of the learning. Yes, we also have collaborations in the aspect of the business, taking something of the research and making a business out of it, etc. So, also tightly coupled with the academy as well. Beyond that, and one last thing, which I didn't mention, I'm also a lecturer in the academy. Yes, so all of this aspect of tutoring and teaching within Deloitte is something that I did globally in Israel, in India, in USA, soon in Canada, etc. All over the globe. Thank you, Tomer. Thanks for the great work you're doing. And switching the gears a little bit, talking about the customers, are you doing any particular customization for clients that are at different stages of their AI adoption in terms of the training and the programs that you recommend to them? Yeah, for sure. Yeah, for sure. So, the first thing we do, of course, is the assessment of what the client needs. Like, what is the problem that eventually we want to solve? That's a crucial part, of course. And beyond that, there are the customized training programs. So, we want to understand where are they in the AI lifespan? Meaning, do they already have a product that utilizes AI and Gen AI? Do they want to enter the market? Is it more for the business leaders? Is it in the aspect of the technical skills? And then we do the dissection into the beginner stage, intermediate stage, and advanced stage. Now, given that today in the world, you know, the technologies of AI and Gen AI are usually running on NVIDIA technologies, so the NVIDIA DLI courses are the fourth fit. Now, when there are specific needs for clients due to their specific algorithms, specific technologies, or maybe, like I said, many of them come and they have a variety of skills and they need it to be custom tailor-made for them. Then we customize this kind of workshops and tutorials that we do. Many times it goes together with the projects. So, usually there is the project, there is the skills that their employees want to acquire, while we usually do the development for them. So, then everything goes hands in hand. Thank you, Tomer, for sharing this. Now, let's switch to Ulrich and talk about the initiatives at Gepion. This is rather a unique initiative that is instrumental to the national AI strategy in Denmark. Ulrich, could you please share with us a little bit about this initiative and maybe help us understand what is special about upskilling tasks that you're facing with this level? Ulrich, yeah, thank you and thanks for having me on the panel. As you said in the beginning, I work for an organization called the Danish Center for AI Innovation, which operates and owns the Gepion supercomputer that was installed last year. So, Gepion is the computer behind me in the picture. It's based on NVIDIA's technology. It is spec'd with 1500 H100s and InfiniBand connecting them. So, it's a very, very powerful machine that ranks number 21 on the top 500 list of supercomputers. But you can think of it as Jensen pointed when he inaugurated the computer last year. At an event we held where he said that this is you should think of it as a lab or a factory that produces advanced models, advanced types of intelligence. And this is the kind of thing we have not previously had in the country. And this is why the investment and the whole project was started to enable this kind of thing to sort of bring that kind of infrastructure to the hands of researchers and innovators in the country. And in Europe. So, it's open to all customers from all sectors. So, it's not a purely academic thing and we are not part of a university or anything like that. We're a separate independent entity. So, it will conduces from corporate, from the public sector, from the academic sector. And it embeds itself into the local ecosystem in terms of training. So, it's been very inspiring to hear from Tolmer and from Dan and Nesta on their efforts to train. So, ours is a small part of a larger thing. So, we also have various national training programs, data science academies. And one of the major skill gaps that we are facing specifically this is because we've never had this kind of thing and most people have never had access to it. One of the major skills gaps is the ability and knowledge on how to efficiently scale your workloads to hundreds of GPUs. Because naturally this is difficult to learn if you've never had the opportunity to do it. So, most people are fairly skilled in doing things on their laptop or doing things on a small local GPU or small server with maybe four or eight GPUs. But very few people have the skill set to scale this to hundreds or thousands of GPUs. So, this is one of the things we're trying to sort of elevate this because otherwise you can't really use the lab at full scale. Training wise, we are relying on internal resources, but also the partnership within video in which we established this. So, as several of the other panelists have mentioned, there's the Deep Learning Institute, there's all this training material. So, we kind of adopt this train the trainer kind of approach where we try to train a set of people that then can train the next set of people. So, it's been very interesting for me also to hear from Mista where they are further down that sort of national path to implementing this. So, I'm also here to get inspiration from others. But this is right now where we stand and I can get back a little bit later to some of the other sort of aspects of this. Thank you so much, Ulrich. I understand this is an interesting, huge project and I appreciate the opportunity for sharing with us. And this is also interesting for us to see how we as DLI can help you and accelerate the processes of upskilling in your teams. Any specific challenges that you are facing with this project that you have initiated? Anything that you would like to highlight? Yeah, we did it very fast. And so, we're a very new organization. Sometimes when you build a supercomputer embedded in an existing organization that's been there for many years, we actually made the forward move of creating a new organization. This is one of the things we face at the moment that simply hiring the right people and getting the teams in place to cope with all the interests. Because Ingridia was also very kind to deliver the system very, very fast. So, we announced the partnership in March last year and we have already built the computer and it's in operation. So, it's almost like the human side of things is lacking behind the technology. Thank you. And how about this continuous learning and the motivation of people to learn continuously with the new technologies and changing fast? And what are you like, what specific tools or methodologies are you using to help people to learn all of these huge skills that they need to and in a fast pace, actually? That's a super good question. One of the things we plan to do because this is this cross sector. A lot of these computers are either owned by a specific organization, a company for instance, that has a big cluster or they tend to be big academic computers shared by academics, but typically not by companies. What we're really hoping to get out of this through the future is to bring all of these sectors and verticals together in a community around the computer so that it will act as a dissemination mechanism in which people will inspire each other. So this is one of the things we're also building up sort of a community online so people can teach each other and inspire each other. Because if there's one thing that really characterizes AI as a field, it is that a technology or technique or new neural network architecture invented for one thing extremely quickly can migrate to benefit a completely different thing. So we saw it with the transformers that were invented for text analytics and very quickly after deep bind adopted it to predict how proteins fold and solve the problem that people had been working on for 50 years. So this sort of speed of translation is extremely fast in AI. So this is what we're hoping to get out of this to create this local community where people can help and train each other and inspire each other. We will also do it, of course, physically hold events where people can read and have a drink together, but also an online community around us. That's a very important component of it. And speaking about the community, I would like to swiftly drift to Dan and maybe we can talk about what you do in Chaos in terms of public and private partnerships, collaboration. Maybe how is this ecosystem helping you to upscale your talent? Yeah. Well, I think the first thing to recognize is that I think everyone would agree is that no single company has all of the answers and that the best AI teams are always constantly learning from academia, industry and open communities and meetups and things. That's all work that said. So I mean, universities obviously produce cutting edge research, but often without the real world constraints. So we love to actively collaborate with institutions like TUM, Technical University of Munich, University of Sofia, Charles University in Prague. And one of our engineers actually teaches in the University of Sofia, which is all about strengthening that link between academic research and real world applications. So that same thing that I've been saying the whole time of bridging the gap between academic and academia and research or academia and industry and making applied, making the making better applied products and output. But these partnerships are they work both ways. So they allow us to work on everybody to work on AI challenges that matter. So the you know, we help researchers align their work with real world problems. Well, you know, we get access to some of the brightest minds in the field and we've there are various scales of working with universities. So for anybody listening to this, you know, there's lots of ways to collaborate from simple things like just kind of meeting up for coffee to paid research where you actively engage university and you fund research. And we're doing one at the moment with Professor Matthias Neissner at TUM where we are funding a PhD student to work on a hard problem that we have deemed in chaos to be like too hard for us to solve alone and that we need external help. And the great thing about this is that it's not just solving this one problem, but we kind of it grows our network. And this is the key thing. It grows our network and we can ask, you know, general questions to this group of people who can provide kind of completely different answers to us and keep us up to date with the real world or the the the the the the world of research as it develops rapidly. So this is great at keeping our finger on the pulse and then going on to something that over said there around them communities. They're invaluable. So I mean conferences like academic conferences like CVPR or CCV are obviously wonderful for for seeing like the latest and greatest and reading white papers and everything and going there to meet kind of your you know your academic heroes and have lunch with them. They're wonderful, but they're all there's also a huge space for local communities. And so as Ulrich said about coming over and meeting up and having a drink going for some food, but coalescing around a thing. So in an Ulrich's case coalescing around a supercomputer would be a dream. But if you can't if there isn't a supercomputer around you, you can always just set up a local or find a local kind of meetup. So Prague AI, for example, is a really good example of kind of a community who regularly meets up, hosts events, brings in speakers. And but also if there isn't one available, set one up guaranteed people will start flocking around you. And I think that's, you know, this sort of key to being kind of open, transparent and available to kind of share ideas and knowledge. I mean, it's what that's how all of this stuff started. And I think it's how all of this stuff will kind of mature and grow. So, but yeah, communities spirit is a huge component to the success of this, this, this whole space. Thanks for sharing, Dan. Definitely. I totally agree with you. This is an important aspect of keeping up to date, sharing insights, learning lessons from each other. This is a great opportunity also to for us as well. As well, the NVIDIA training, we're also collaborating a lot with universities, with academia, with our educator programs and helping them, enabling them to and empowering them with the resources that we share with them to make their jobs a little easier and help them to get connected with the industry and academia, which is which is very valued and important. And now turning to you, Mesna, maybe you can share with us with this national huge initiative. What and how does the day collaborate with public and private sector universities or international organizations and its efforts to successfully implement and scale their current initiatives? Well, as well, as well, as well as what my fellow panelists have mentioned, so they adopt a multi, multi stakeholder collaboration approach. So we have a very defined tracks and we cooperate in parallel with these tracks. So we're trying to ensure the AI talent and development and deployment align with the needs of the academia, industry, as well as the government. These collaborations are essential for building the stronger I and advancing to our goals. So basically, I could name four key collaborations. So there's the public sector partnership. We actively work closely with the government entities and to achieve their digital transformations, strategies and workforce development and how AI can help them with that. So we ensure that the public sector employees are equipped with necessary AI skills to drive the innovation. So one of these initiatives was national data governance courses, which have been utilized by more than a thousand two hundred officials in the government to be able to strengthen the the regularity and to strengthen the regularity of the MEI access to the Arabia. Another also model that what also has been mentioned a lot of times is working closely with academia and research collaboration. So the data would partner with the leading national universities are to drive AI research and talented developments, ensuring there is a strong pipeline for AI professional research. So we do have a joint research center with the King Fahad University of the Kiliman and Minerals, also with the King Abdullah University of the Science and Technology. And also we are enabling local universities to team up with international universities like trying to team up with Pinombia and Purdue universities. So trying to have a dual programs and so far, ensuring that we have the tracks in AI within the enterprise. And also we have the industrial, as has been mentioned, we work very closely with industry. We're trying to help the people, the professionals working in the industry to have access to our last year at uni. So today I will always focus on cooperating with the top AI companies, including NVIDIA for sure, and this is important field. So for example, we are a country running a generative AI professional training, which aims to train more than 4,000 startups in AI, and actually it's in cooperation with NVIDIA and we are teaching them to train more. Having multiple tracks within that program. So we have trained the trainer track where we have instructors, they go and cover different area, geotrophic regions in South Arabia, schools, and then the nationals that have this experience. And also we have a special track for our engineers where they go to the digital AI. And as Sedia has been mentioned, the importance of acceleration when working with GPUs, which requires more advanced self-adaptation background. Last but last least, the Sedia also is looking for the global cooperation, which is important, especially in AI policy and development. So Sedia is committed to shaping the global AI landscape through international cooperation and policy development. One of the key global initiatives is the ICARE, which is the International Center for Artificial Intelligence, Research and Ethics, which is established by Sedia as the first of its time in the region. Where the ICARE is dedicated to advancing AI research, promoting ethical AI practices and ensuring responsible AI development. And it's basically crucial role in shaping the policies that framework that would guide fair, transparent and efficient deployment for the AI technology. So that's a career that� is also a church for 30 plantations". Wow, this is huge. And I understand the complexity of the, and the benefits as well, when collaborating with so many stakeholders and building the right ecosystem for such a large scale project. And I believe that this collaborations are the key to succeeding to these projects. Would you agree with me, Messner? Yes, absolutely. We make clear tracks down the frontiers and categories and the work end up in all the details. I agree. Nice. Thank you. Thank you so much for sharing those insights and the way you handle this huge project maybe. Ulrich, how about yourselves at Gepheon? What kind of public and private collaborations would you like to highlight that is helping you to succeed in the projects that you're taking? Yes, the initiative itself is in fact a public-private partnership. There's an outstanding tradition in many of the Nordic countries including Denmark for these kinds of public-private partnerships. So Gepheon is an investment that's been made jointly by the export, the public side, the government through the Export Investment Foundation in Denmark and the no private health Novo Nordisk Foundation. And there is in Scandinavia a long-standing tradition for having these enterprise foundations. So essentially where the owners of a company or corporation, they leave the controlling ownership of the company to a foundation that then gives away the profits. to research or other public goods. So it's kind of private money for public good. So this is what the Novo Nordisk Foundation is and it is now. It has grown due to the success of the investment arm of the company and also the success of Novo Nordisk, which is this big pharmaceutical company that operates in the world in terms of annual payouts. So more than a billion US dollars was awarded last year in grants for research and other types of initiatives that improve the lives of people and the sustainability of society and the climate. So this is kind of the goal. So part of the goal of Gepheon is to advance those agendas to sort of make the world better. So it's not the goal is not the computer itself, but mostly what it can be used for. The kinds of things that could be advanced with accelerated computing using this. So it is in that sense baked into the whole initiative that there is a very much a private public relationship here. And this is also why it was imperative to create a basis, a model under which everyone could access the computer. Both commercial companies, startups, the public sector that may have and needs as well, as well as the academic sector. So that everyone could cross fertilize, as I mentioned earlier. And the model that we've come up to do this is actually a payment layer. So everyone pays for services and pay for compute. And it acts as an integration layer because the historical tradition, of course, in the commercial segment is exactly this. You pay for services at AWS or Azure, wherever. But in the academic sector, there's a slightly different tradition where there's more of a tendency to build a large infrastructure and then it's offered for free, but then everyone wants to use it. And then you have to put in all of these committees or evaluation panels that gets to decide who gets to use it for which project for how long or how many compute hours. And the analysis we did leading up to creating this very clearly pointed at the fact that this was somewhat of a risky model in the AI space where everything is so fast paced. That if you incur a long delay in access to execute on your idea in AI because you have to wait for some committee to review your compute our application. It actually is a huge break on innovation and research in AI. So this is why we try to put in this model where people pay because if you pay, it's like at AWS, it's immediate access. So it's really put in to minimize this. And of course, the foundation and other foundations then fund the academics with a compute budget so that they can afford to use the computer. So this is kind of the model. And we are also hoping that it will act as a common leading ground for collaborations across different sectors between companies because it's a neutral ground thing. Sometimes if computer is based with one organization, other organizations are reluctant to sort of use the computer. Even if two companies are collaborating, if the computer belongs to one company, it's sometimes a bit complicated. So we're hoping to be able to create sort of a meeting ground. One of the reasons and motivations for creating it locally in Denmark and not just sort of using the cloud is that Denmark sits on a lot of data on its population. It's also using the data, health data, health data, social economic data that go back decades. And this data can be exploited to gain insights into how disease develops over decades and generations. But this kind of data is very, very sensitive. It's very person sensitive. So there is a reluctancy to put that on someone else's computer in a different country. So for that reason alone, it was a driving force to create something that is not only KPUs, but it's also a lot of security and a lot of multi-tenancy and shielding users from each other. Because that's what we need to do and build on top of the infrastructure in order to actually host all these different entities. The take-home message is that this is established as a private-public partnership with the very aim of getting people from different sectors and verticals to meet. And in order to do that, we need to create security that shields people from each other and you need to come up with a model that access and integration docking layer for everyone that works for all customers. Thank you, Ulrich and everyone for sharing such great insights and your examples of how you are building the partnerships and how these partnerships are helping you to succeed in your projects. So as we come to the end of our discussion, I'd like to ask each of you to share one key takeaway or piece of advice perhaps for organizations dealing with the AI skills gap. What is one actionable step companies can take right now to start addressing this challenge within their organizations? We can take turns and answer this question and we will kick off with Tomer, please. Sure. So I think the first thing you need to do is to start learning and then you need to keep learning. This is going to be an endless pursuit right now. Organizations need to react fast. Not just because of the gap skills, because of the impact on the products, the new technologies that are coming every day. Sometimes, you know, there are companies that a new technology come and replaces their entire product. So everyone must be agile in this time because of the transformations and impact on the entire businesses. So the leadership must foresee where it's going, where it's coming and how to direct it. So it's crucial to the organization and then across the organization with the employees, etc. So it's crucial to the organization and the organization that you're going to be able to do. Thank you. Dan, what is your piece of advice? Yeah, sure thing. So the best advice that I can give for addressing the skills gap, and particularly at the level of when you're, imagine you're hiring people, you're trying to build a strong team. And it's really around like hire people that will break down silos between machine learning and traditional engineering. You're far too often you get folks who are too focused on data engineering or just the modeling of something and completely omit the rest of the whole pipeline. And it's important if you want to make sure that the folks in your, in the rest of your company, so the skills gap, not just of learning AI technologies, but other people understanding how AI works in the broader picture, that your traditional engineers understand about AI. Your AI engineers understand about traditional software delivery and as Tomer said, delivering valuable products. That's what's important. And that's like, it's AI isn't just about data science. It can't be. It's about software that works in scale. Thank you so much. And Demesa, what's your piece of advice? I think it's really important when we're upscaling the workforce that identify the key elements of AI. AI rules, rules that is needed. So ensuring that they have a clear understanding of the roles. And then we're training upon that and training into the daily work. So like, for example, micro learning or mentors. So they keep practicing it. They keep doing it and keep developing and keep up with the speed. I think that's just the important thing that you like parts in, in upscaling. Thank you. Ulrich, over to you. Thanks. As Tomer said, this is very, very fast moving. And as pretty much everyone has pointed out, this makes it difficult to keep up skills wise. And Jensen Huang, your own CEO said this last year in a very beautiful way that it's kind of like a spaceship that takes off. If you regain the ship doing things, working in this space, you don't sense how fast it's actually moving. But if you are not on board the ship. It's very, very quickly moves away from where you are. So the best recommendation I would give is to get on the ship and try building something, doing something. Training people because a lot of the skills are learned that Stan pointed out by doing it, trying it out. And so we can only do so much with formal courses. A lot of it is being in the game, trying to build things. Thank you all for the wonderful panel and discussion. I have enjoyed listening to all of your insights as you come from such diverse background and industries. Thank you so much for the great discussion. And I hope that our followers have enjoyed and hopefully we can connect and discuss more. And as we wrap up our panel, I wish everyone a great GTC and great learning experiences ahead of GTC. Thank you so much. Thank you. It's been a pleasure. Thanks everyone. Bye guys. Thank you. Thanks. Bye guys. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
