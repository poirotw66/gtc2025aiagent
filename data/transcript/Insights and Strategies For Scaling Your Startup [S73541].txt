 8s I teach the smart people how long the car towsels give us how nice the car that is was Thank you. Good morning and welcome to NVIDIA GTC 2025 conference. My name is Alexander Martineau. I manage NVIDIA startup community in the Nordic region and Central Eastern Europe. And it is my pleasure to host a panel of leading voices in the European startup ecosystem today. Each of them brings a unique perspective on the topic that we will be discussing, which is how to scale an AI startup in today's Europe. And whether you are enacting or maybe a future startup founder, a policymaker, a startup ecosystem enabler maybe, it is our goal that you take away a few valuable insights and hopefully also actionable advice on how we can all help European startup successfully scale here on the continent. But before we dive into it, let's make a quick round of introductions of our panelists, starting with Jacob, Philip, Samantha, and last but not least, Stefan. So go ahead. Thank you. Thank you very much, Alexander. My name is Jacob Amelow. I'm a co-founder of Go Autonomous and leading AI development and product. Go Autonomous is a document automation company that delivers value for our B2B enterprise customers. Yeah. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. My name is Philip. I'm employed at Applied AI. We are the leading open access accelerator for trustworthy AI in the EU. My role as an AI, senior AI strategist. I'm also a member of several expert commissions in the field of AI and a mentor for startups. Very happy to be here. Thanks for having me. Thank you, Philip. Pleasure to have you. Go ahead, Samantha. Sorry. Hi. Nice to meet you all. I'm Samantha Durazalmi. I'm a partner of a fund named Alaya. Alaya is a pan-European fund dedicated to early stage B2B companies. We've been investing in the field of AI for the last past 22 years. We have close to 1 billion in the management. We'll stick a trench for a couple hundred K up to 10, 12 million first ticket. Very happy to be here. I'm Stéphane. So I'm Stéphane Akena. Thanks for the invitation. So I'm the CTU of GenC, which is a French HPC agency. So our mission on the infrastructure side is to provide access to supercomputers for researchers from academia and industry for their workload in numerical simulation, AI and quantum computing. Fantastic. Thank you, everyone, and welcome. It is rare that we have so much, so many top voices in the ecosystem in one place at one time. So it's a privilege to have all of you here at GTC. And first things first, right? Let's talk about where we stand when it comes to, you know, the startup experience. And Jacob, I think you're uniquely positioned in that sphere as you are representing a scaling startup, homegrown, European based. So why don't you tell us a little bit more about, you know, your specific issues and challenges that you are experiencing and you have experienced so far while trying to scale and grow your startup here? Yeah. Thank you very much. I think, first of all, building a startup anywhere in the world is a roller coaster. However, I believe that the condition for launching a startup in Europe and in the European Union is great. While there's always things that we as founders and business owners want to improve and change, we have been very sort of like satisfied with the experience building an AI startup in Europe. And especially on the level of digitalization in Europe and access to skilled workforce, I think we are sort of like in a great position. When it comes to some of the sort of like challenges we have met over the time, it is we spent the first one and a half year bootstrapping ourselves here in Europe, which all the sort of like benefits and drawbacks that has to it. But when after one and a half year we wanted to seek outside capital, we saw that there was actually just one way of doing it because external capital in terms of debt financing for especially tech startups is very difficult to come about. So, so we went the VC route and the VC community and the VC sort of like ecosystem in Europe is very well founded. So, I think there's a lot of different VC's out there from big industrial players to smaller specialized ones. And I think the only sort of like drawback we have in Europe compared to the US is that the risk willingness might be a little bit less in Europe as compared to in the US. We at least have seen companies that is comparable to others in Europe getting a 2, 3x time valuation when they're going out and seeking VC money. And then this might be due to several reasons but one of the reasons that we at least see is a little bit of the European mindset where you're very much sort of like nation focused, whereas in the US you're more focused on the entire Federation. So, in Europe, if you're talking about Mistro, it's a French startup. If you're talking about Novo Nordisk, it's a Danish company. But if you talk about any company in the US, you always say that's an American company. So, we are from this beginning a little bit more narrow focused, which makes it a little bit harder to go about and go out into the into the world. Awesome. I love your positive perspective on things, Jacob. We definitely have talent. And one of the challenges is certainly the access to capital and the way the way we go around with with or startups have the access to the necessary funding. But I want to before giving a heading it over to Samantha because I think I see the she she's willing to. I think she's willing to jump on that VC comment. Let's put Jacobs experience into into a bit of a perspective right fill it because you are again you're uniquely positioned to speak for the community from the research experience and the work that that open air has done. So what do you hear from the broader community in terms of the challenges and what we we need to improve when we want to help the European startup scale here in the continent? Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex. Well, this is obviously a huge topic and I can fully agree with Jacob Jacob. We conducted a large scale study among Gen AI startups in Europe last year. And part of this was also to delve into the challenges the Gen AI startups in the EU are facing. And there's one major part which stands out and it's also not surprising. It's financing, obviously. If you look at the numbers, if you take Germany, for instance, in 2023, we had like a bit less than one and a half billion US dollars cumulative investment for about 700 AI startups, which we have. If you put that into perspective, one and a half billion for 700 AI startups compared with what's only one startup. Let's take OpenAI, for example, in the US gets it's obviously very hard to be competitive in this way. But here I can also relate to what you Jacob say. More and more founders I also meet bootstrapping is a viable option for them. I mean, it has advantages and disadvantages. You need to think of what to do quite an early stage because there's a part of path dependency, I would say, where this can lead you. But overall, it's a viable option. Besides having financing as a major challenge in the EU ecosystem, number two was not surprising, I would say regulation. Let's not delve into that in the AI Act, other points were compute. But here the EU is doing a lot in these days and we were building AI factories. We have EU HPC and many other great actors. We also have the NVIDIA inception program where I know many German startups, which are partners of us are also participating. So this is something which is being addressed today and which is urgently needed as well, of course. Two last points. Talent is obviously also a huge bottleneck. There's a high correlation, of course, between the availability to afford talent and the availability of capital. I mean, the more capital you have, the higher likelihood you can fund some good ML engineers. I mean, OpenAI partially pays like 500k to 1 million for the AI engineers. If you have an average funding in Europe of, let's say, 2 million, well, the math doesn't work, does it? So important issue here. And coming to an end, the last point is data, of course. And here, I believe in Europe, we have unique positioning. If we think of Germany, for example, we have this famous German Mittelstand with all these small companies, which nobody ever heard of, but which are the backbone of the European economy. They have some unique data ports and these can be used, especially for AI status, like building the vertical foundation models, for example. And here I see some huge opportunities. Awesome. Awesome. So the what I'm hearing is that having the talent can can work both ways, right? It's a boon. We do have excellent technical talent here. But the question is, how do we keep all those people? And that's the that's the also at least partly or to a big extent, that's a money question. So Samantha, what about the VC perspective on that? And just simply, you know, making sure that we have enough money for the local startups to scale? I'm not sure I'm I would be responsible for the total money that comes in Europe. But you have a point in Europe, the the startup like overall, we're not just talking about AI startup here in Europe. We're struggling to have late state funding. It's not much more about early stages. I mean, we've been doing a lot of work, even with some governmental initiative for the last past 10, 15 years. But where we're struggling the most is on the late state funding. The moment and this this funding is needed at the moment of scaling for those companies. So we have we don't have that much of investment fund that can take the lead from series B up to pre IPO. So, Jacob, you were talking about cultural things and maybe kind of a risk adverse cultural thing that we have in Europe. I think that's and I don't take it for me personally, but I think that we are we are working with the market that we have as well. And the problem is on the on the on the on the on the missing part part of the late stage funding. But why is this is because on the exit part, we don't have the market as well. So if we if I have to pinpoint maybe one big challenge that we have in the economy in the European economy as all is the lack of, I would say, strategic collaborations with a product or others mergers and acquisition that are not happening that much and lack of liquidity on the IPO. We don't have any IPO market, not that much as in the US. So the why we don't have that much of late state funding and valuation on the table and this risk taking part that you were mentioning, that is much more than just cultural is about the market that we have. If we had IPO track very a lot of liquidity on the market on a dedicated European market that there is some initiative, but we're still debating. We may we might have like late stage funding as well and much more from abroad as well. So for me, the major point is about exit strategy, merger and acquisition IPO liquidity that we don't have on the M&A side and on the exit side. That might be one of the consequences or the cause of the why we lack of funding on the late funding. And you pinpoint this. But obviously, you were saying, Jacob, that the US market is dealing with the US, right? We're dealing with a fragmented Europe in terms of many angles. So for me, the one big challenges that we see in AI company that we have in portfolio, how to leverage the expertise of the company to expand commercially across borders, which is for me the priority number one for any company that wants to scale in this in this AI world. So, yeah, many, many points here, but exit funding and commercial expansion. Absolutely. A lot to uncover there. But let's hold that thought for for the next part of the discussion, because I really want us to come up with a few a few advice or maybe just, you know, things that we would love to have. Right. Although it's not completely up to us to make those changes. But before we go there, perhaps a few words from you, Stefan, on what can broader ecosystem partners that are, I would say, unique to Europe can do to help bridge that that, you know, scaling challenge of the European startups. So more specifically, what can we do on the infrastructure side, how can we help startups get those resources that that they would otherwise not be having in, I would say, most of the parts of the world. Yeah, you're right, Alexander. It has been already pointed by Philip and brings with his talk. And it's also it was a subject during the last AI action summit last week in Paris. So access to compute either for the training or for the inference at a commercial scale is really key for the for the startup. So what we try to do in France since 2019 is to allow access to public research infrastructure. So we have, for example, a machine like Genzee in back of me. This is a machine which is currently powered by around 4,000 GPU, NVIDIA GPUs. And it's really important just to allow each AI to access to this public infrastructure in order to have a kind of fair and equal access to research infrastructure. So what we what we did, we also set up kind of tailored access. So it's very easy. They can access in a few days to the machine. They can use the machines that can be also supported. The support is also very important. So the success of the machine now will last for example last year. We supported around 1500 research project in AI from academia, from industry, from startups, for large companies. And when we do some survey about the satisfaction, they are very happy about two things. The first one is the number of GPUs. And the second one is also the support, because it's not so easy from to jump from a laptop to super computer. And again, here providing skills for allowing the startup to get benefit of this infrastructure is something really important. So they need to they need to be supported for installing the framework to launch the training. They need to be supported for optimizing the application for being trained as well. So all this integrated offer, it is really important. It's not only talking about putting GPUs. It's also putting an integrated offer to support the community. And then the other point is when they are they train the model, then they want to do commercial activities in France at scale. So we need to have in Europe, which is not for the one exactly the case, a very strong offer, a sovereign offer of European clouders able to take the following step after us. We are public infrastructure, we cannot support commercial activities, but we need to have in Europe also strong clouders able to take the stick and to provide the same level of support to the European startups. So this idea of this continuum, this public and private continuum of infrastructure supported by a lot of teams for for engaging the communities, supporting the startups, allowing them to take benefit is something also very important. And we've and I will give another example it doesn't also related by Philip so access to data and access to models is really important. So we need to give access to open source models. It has been also one of the results of the last AX summit. We need to develop in Europe open source models to give also again the same chance to everyone to access to public infrastructure to access to open source models. And we need also to unlock data. So one of the major issue is to good to find good data, good quality data for training the model. So we need in Europe to find a way to unlock private data sets which are too loud for the month. We need to find the ways, the interesting stuff to make this data available. And we are in Europe, one of the biggest producer of data in the world. So it's really important to federate different data lakes, data sources with the supercomputers and to find a way to give access to these data for the startups. Absolutely. And that's a great point, Stefan, because I do believe that a lot of the conversations about the money don't get me wrong, but but it's more than that. Right. And I think we here in Europe, we can compensate, if you will, for for being one or two steps behind in the in the funding game with something that that that are our unique advantages. And that is the the access to data and access to infrastructure. So over over to you, Jacob, to maybe say a few words of what your unique experience has been with that. Have you have you gotten some access to to to the infrastructure from one of the bigger European projects? And what are your thoughts on on building the the local cloud providers in Europe? Again, data infrastructure, right back to these two points. Yeah, thank you very much. I agree. And there's a lot of interesting discussions that we could go into here. But I think sort of like on this topic, I completely agree. And one of the European sort of like advantages is our access to to data. We have even though I think a lot of researchers will say that we miss a lot of data. We have a huge amount of data available here in the European Union. And also with the sort of like recent years investment in these public HPC clusters, there has been sort of like made compute available for startups and research communities like hasn't been available before. In our own sort of like experience, we have relied very much on the data of our customers, which have also allowed us to build some very sort of like specific models that can do very sort of like specific things. But for example, we have been allowed access to the project, which is a Danish sort of like initiative within the foundation and the IFO foundation, who has built a HPC cluster here in Denmark and is now allowing public access to this cluster so that we now have the possibility that we wouldn't have had a year ago in terms of training foundational models, which I believe is a huge underserved market in Europe. In Europe, we only really have a few actors who are doing this. So really sort of like investing in making foundational models. And also, as you said, Philip, with the German middle stand, sort of like being able to make very vertical sort of like models like you see with Corti now having published a health model that can go in and really help serving that area. And that is sort of like one of the big opportunities that I see we have here in Europe in the coming years. And Philip over to you. How big do you think is that an advantage, right? Our access to data, our potential efforts to Europe wide efforts to get access to scaling startups to give them the access to the infrastructure that, you know, let's be very honest, right? That's a that's a that's a huge cost factor for especially for for someone who wants to to build a unicorn or or or go international in a big way. So what what what what's your perspective on that? Yeah, good point. First of all, I think there's like super exciting times. We can see it's a it's a wonderful time to build startups at the application layer in these times when the model issue in the US another topic, I would say it's a big topic. We obviously need those foundation models at the same time. The the life cycle is quite short. We will we all notice the deep seek of announcement some time ago and what this did to the yeah stock markets to say the least at the application layer. It is totally different, of course, and there's so many opportunities and here I see a huge advantage for European startups, which is also the matter of trust to give you an example. If you go to to a German SME and let's say South Germany, and you say you have a potential application which could solve one of his major pain points. And you are a startup from southern Germany. You have good chances. I would say to do the project if you come from northern Germany, that will become a bit difficult. You are here for silver for silver, but you need to be really good and have some really convincing arguments. USA, China, whatever of not an option. It's a huge advantage if you know your local ecosystem and embedded in your local ecosystem. If you gain this trust and I think trust is a key point here, then you will be able to gain access to these data parts to connect these data parts and to yeah. Build a vertical also host and clear foundation models. We are talking about. Trust trust is the key word. And with that, I want to go back to Samantha, because it's meant that you said something that that I found fascinating that I wanted to build up on. We need essentially more exit opportunities is is making the European enterprise believe in and trust our scaling startups. One way of potentially solving that that conundrum right that we just don't have enough IPOs and big money flowing into the scaling. I don't know if it's the key. I don't know if it's the key. And to go back with what Philip was saying. At the same time, I feel what you're saying very beneficial, meaning that you have to build trust and you want to work with local player because you feel like in your you're in a good position and you have enough trust to work with. But at the same time, it's not allowing us to build European champion that kind of behavior meeting working with local player. Right. So I'm a bit. I don't know if bias the right word, but I don't I don't like I don't really know how we're going to play the global game if we keep on working on very local player. This is what you were talking about. So to answer your question, Alexander, I I don't know. I don't have the key. But what is true is that we have to work. And this has been done on the European level on regulatory challenges that we have. We can talk about the A.I. Act compliance. We can talk about the data privacy and GDPR. And yes, the all they were mentioned, the the the this big event that happened last week in Paris, the A.I. Action Summit or the A.I. Summit. And all was about ethical A.I. as a differentiator. And I'm just questioning here. I understand the transparent, fair, explainable A.I. that we were talking about, the stress that you were talking, Alexander. Can we make it as a competitive advantage globally? This is my question. And I hope yes, definitely. But it's true question why we're talking about scaling, right? So true question why we're talking about by by sense and by definition, a Europe that should be as big as as as us. But since again, it's really federated and really localized and we have such behavior that we're working with local and very local player. Is it is it the differentiator that we want to have on a European scale to make sure that will make the game different on a global on a global scale? This is a question. I'm sorry to answer your question by question. This typical investor way to believe. So, yeah, question about this ethical A.I. as a differentiator. And I stick I took it like as the trust that you were talking about, the transparentness, the fairness on a far explainable A.I. But yes, definitely, if this is the key for us to make this game feasible for European and pan European company, then let's play it. Is it the key to make sure that we'll have more exits? Honestly, I don't know. Again, we're lagging behind in terms of amount put in company. When a company is raising a certain amount of money in the US, we're raising one tenth or one third, like between one third and one tenth. So we're lagging again behind in terms of funding because we're lagging in terms of exit and maybe evaluation that I've seen quite in some lecture that I had. The median of a European company that is sold and that was backed by the by the by the by the VC world is thirty eight million. So it's not even the price that we we paying for a series A company. What in the US is much larger. So this is where we have to to point it at the priority. And is the ethical or the trust that we have behind or a company enough? I don't think so. And and that is again, that's a great question. I love I love posing more questions and response to questions. So let's do a quick experiment. I will direct that question of Samantha's to everyone here on the panel. So let's do a quick round of your opinions. Do you think that focusing on, you know, transparent, explainable? AI would be a global advantage for European companies at that level of scaling, right? Not not not early stage, not just building building something for, you know, a local ecosystem or a few local middle, middle, small, small kind of stage companies and enterprises. But but will it really help build a a global champion? Let's go. Let's go starting with Stefan, maybe then to fill it in Jacob. Thanks for the question, Samantha. So I will answer not urgency, but I may pass on a point of view. I think there is a third way between US and China to play. And it was really the outcome of the summit again. Honestly, we don't need to make the race like the Americans for training. And read of foundational models, which are not used at the end. What is important is to a few foundational models and then to put all the burden I said by Philip into verticalization and the use about each industry. And this we can do it by being following our value in Europe and our value are on explainable and trustworthy on all these value we are spurring together. And I'm and I'm pretty sure that you're already the outcome we had already with some startups and also from large companies, because in our facilities, for example, let's say 80% of the users from industry are from startups. And then the big fish are taking the outcome of startups and using them. And definitely they are interested to have this alternative way in which they can understand what is provided by the models. They can trust the model again, as they can engage some critical processes of their companies. So honestly, I'm pretty sure there is a path for Europe. Of course, if we are united, not one French against one Danish or against one German, again, etc. If we are a bit united, there is a way. And there is a, I think, an urgency now to really stop making this race with the Chinese and American, have our own foundational model and put all the effort in the commoditization and the specialization of the model to one industry by verticals. And definitely I'm a strong believer on that. And open source could play a big role on that. If we can have open source model, then we can accelerate on the specialization after that. Yeah, fully agree on the open source aspects and also otherwise. And also for me, it's, I definitely said, trustworthiness is definitely key, but not the only key. I mean, especially when we look at B2C applications, I think trustworthiness is like essential. If we look at B2B applications, often yes, but not always. Is trustworthiness a key differentiator here? I mean, it depends on the service you offer. If we take this pen, for example, I don't know if it was manufactured in Europe or not. But if we do anomaly detection for the production of this pen, we do not need to have a trustworthy explanation behind it, so to say. We need technological advancement in the technological state of the art, but it doesn't really need to be explainable why this pen is classified as good or bad, as long as the result is fine. But of course, if we talk about, yeah, consumer interaction here, for example, this is totally different. So of all, trustworthiness is important, but we also need to focus on the pure technology behind the applications. Yes, thank you very much. I also think it's a it's a brilliant question. I think actually the trustworthiness that I think there's a little bit of a sort of like ethical and trusted is potentially also overlapping, but not completely sort of like interchangeable. But for us, we working with big B2B enterprise and sort of like one billion euro revenue or more. And for them, sort of like trust is a right to play. If they do not trust in what we are doing, if they do not trust in the way we are handling the data and the way that we're handling the trade secrets, all of these different things, then we cannot serve them. So I believe that actually in the B2B area, trust is going to be a right to play. And here for me, I think it's very interesting to have a discussion about generative versus predictive models of like encoder based and decoder based models. Because we are working very much on encoder based models to say like, here we go and we encode the data, we make predictions directly on the data, instead of having a model read it and then trying to replicate some answers afterwards. And here, this makes us a huge advantage in terms of we can say exactly where we got all the information from beginning. They say exactly when we're training, what is it that goes into to where. And if we are using these technologies and then use decoder, sort of like models for what the XT should be used for when it is you need to have some problems. And you need to be be creative, then I believe we can make a setup here that is very trustworthy. And I do believe trust is going to be a right to play in this in this area. I don't believe that it's going to be a differentiator because I believe that over time, everyone would need to sort of like build that trust for their consumers being either B2C or B2B. But I do believe we in Europe has an advantage in terms of this is very ingrained in what we do. So I do believe that we will potentially be a step in front there right now. But over time, everyone would need to catch up and to your Stefan and your Philips comment on sort of like building virtual models. I completely agree. This is going to be the differentiator having a few big models that you can then leverage out and compress into more distilled versions that can serve a specific vertical and be more efficient for serving exactly that vertical. So that is going to be the future. Excellent. So what I took from that round is that trust is not an advantage. It's a precondition. So unless you unless we build trustworthy AI, we won't be we won't be a player. Right. And this is not something we obviously have to to to be a leader on on the ethical AI. But this is, again, not something that is that is a differentiator whether European startups would be successful as unicorns. Right. As as as the next big things or not. And that leads me back to you, Samantha. So what can we actually do to make sure that that we stand and I'm I am echoing Stefan's opinion there that that we stand as as a united Europe with a big enough market that can at least follow that path of big exits doing the right IPO sizes and enabling the startups that that want to be global champions to reach those valuations where we can be. To reach those valuations where we can say, yes, we we we can compete. We can compete with those numbers or Sunday on the on the in terms of the pure money. So you would probably be the person to to speak up on that. First, there is something that we can work on altogether. It's much more on the kind of lobbying on the regulatory challenges that all the company has. We can all work together towards this lobby towards government to make sure that at least on on on on the regulatory speaking point of view, we have kind of Europe that is federated and we're not talking to local locally to some extent to country by country and so on. So that's what will be a key differentiator or a key element for our company to scale European ways. Second, I think, and it goes with goes with a little bit is to make sure that we build a strong talents and R&D strategy. We have a lot of European AI research herbs. We can talk about in here in France. We can talk about to the to me in Germany, Cambridge for sure. For sure, EPFL in Switzerland and so on. So we have a bunch of research herbs, AI research herbs, that are making a tremendous job where we are chasing a lot of company early stage companies that are coming out from here. And we have to leverage from this AI cluster to make big cluster and make sure that altogether we build a talent and R&D strategy on a European scale. So for me, this is the two main thing, the two main priority to make sure. And again, coming back to my point on the commercialization and the expansion across borders. If we have this, the company will be it will be easier for the company to scale, at least in Europe, where we try to build champion European champion here and start with maybe AI friendly regions. I'm talking, I'm talking, I'm thinking about France, I'm thinking about Germany, UK, Nordics, before tackling highly regulated markets. So if we ended up with a consortium European wise, it would be easier for a company to scale in Europe. Because for now, for a company to go abroad, to go in somewhere else, they have to adapt themselves because on every single country, they have to adapt in terms of processing, in terms of compliance, in terms of customer onboarding, in terms of adoption. AI adoption is not the same in every single country in Europe. So I think that we have to go from what has been done and keep on going on good initiative on the AI regulatory speaking compliance, let's say. And second, make sure that since it's one of the main things and one of the main differentiators from abroad or talents, making sure that we have a common strong talent and R&D strategy European wise. And I think that those things will end up with much more and more and more and more and more fund raise and even with exits. On the exit part, I think that we have to build with the talent or R&D strategy that I was talking about, this AI research herb. There are some people from this AI research herb that ended up in corporates. Some are building their own company. And I think that the mixture of both is great because at the end, the ones that will be ending up in corporates will be the next acquirer of our company. So we need to have this behavior in corporates to make sure that they understand what the startups are building in and making sure that those companies and those corporates, those big strategies will be the next acquirer. So the building of the talent or R&D strategy, I think that we have to bring the strategists at this stage, very early stages, to make sure that they understand exactly what we're building, to make sure that they envision the startups that we help on scaling in their future roadmap. While they try to build in, they need to build up. Talent strategy. Let's talk about this. I would like your perspective first, Philipp, and then obviously, Stefan, please speak up on that as well. What are you seeing in terms of things happening on the global European level to build exactly what Samantha has been talking about? So is that happening already? Are the decision makers aware on both national and European level? So what are you seeing there, Philipp? Yeah, excellent question. First of all, I would say we need to differentiate between two kind of founders. First time a founder is very simple. They are extrinsically motivated. If you're extrinsically motivated, you go to the US, simply put. But the good news is, number two, most founders are very intrinsically driven in Europe. So they have purpose. They want to build something unique, which also benefits society in a broader sense. And this is our big advantage, I think. I can see all over across Europe. I mean, Samantha, you mentioned a lot of great institutions we have. There's so much effort and also joint efforts being made now to create this European ecosystem, not only in our national countries, but also across the EU as a whole. I mean, we have initiatives like GNI for you or Invest for EU and so on. And these are huge also financial commitments. So we are building this ecosystem and also connecting the dots, so to say, between academic institutions, private investors, VCs, family officers, politics, and so on, and so on, to build this ecosystem and, yeah, as I said, to connect all the dots. I think what is needed from a political side is to, yeah, reduce the paperwork, as always in the EU. And also what you mentioned, Samantha, to make it easier to attract talent also in the European sense, not only in the national sense. I mean, in Estonia, for example, you can find a startup in 15 minutes online. If you want to do it in Germany or France, good luck. It will take you six to eight weeks. And the same also accounts if you want to hire some top talent, which does not come from your own country. I see a lot of opportunities here. Don't want to open another topic. But this is also something where AI can help the governments to reduce paperwork. I think this is a separate topic we can talk about. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you, Philip. Stefan, over to you. Yeah, I can also comment on the infrastructure and service side. In fact, we need to operate at scale, at European scale. This is the only way for us to survive and to compete. So it has been annulized already since 1918 with the creation of URHPC. So now in Europe, you have a common vehicle called URHPC, federating the European Commission and 34 member states with the mission to provide the same level of, we are providing the French shovel, but at scale. So now URHPC is operating large-scale supercomputers. I mean, one being in Finland, in Spain, Italy. This year, there will be a big deployment of a supercomputer called Jupiter in Germany. And we are working from another big supercomputer called Alice Rockok in France next year. So in terms of URHPC facilities, we need to operate at scale. And we also need to provide not only the infrastructure, but also all the services. And now again, URHPC has launched an initiative called AI Factories, in which they try to provide this kind of one-stop shop in which you have access to compute, to services in terms of user support, in terms of training, in terms of collaboration, in terms of access to VC, in terms of access to data sources with high quality, etc. So they already selected seven AI Factories in some countries. There is no phone call and we applied last month. So we are crossing fingers to be selected. But this is really important to provide not only access to compute, but also access to services and ecosystem building. This is something important, providing this cross-collaboration between research and industry, as said by Samantha, is really important, this link between two. And we need to reinforce it. It's really something important. And also perhaps a differentiator. We could have also again in Europe. If you see how AI is evolving in the US, it's really driven by industry. I'm sorry to be blunt. In China, I cannot tell you. But in Europe, we have this challenge to have this cross-collaboration between research and industry, and we need to exploit it at scale, at scale, really at scale. And the last point, it has been also pointed by Philippe. There was also last week this announcement on InvestEI. It's also a major investment at European level with 200 billion euros funded by industry, 75% funded by industry, and 25% funded by the European Commission, with the ambition to continue to invest at scale. And the first investment which has been announced was related to which is called gigafactories. So the goal is to deploy in Europe, in the common years, four big infrastructure, 100,000 GPUs each. So we see that there is an acceleration in the perception of how Europe needs to be united. And I'm quite optimistic. If we can follow our way, our path, if we can unite research and industry, have this cross-collaboration, we will attract skills. After that, we need to retain the skills. But at least we can attract skills by promoting our values and providing infrastructure and services. I love your perspective, Stefan. It is ambitious, right? It's challenging. I think it's not being done anywhere else in the world because, like you mentioned, U.S. and China are working in very different ways. Their startups won't be able to benefit from that. But it is not easy for sure. And I have two questions there. One, maybe for Jacob, on a more kind of a personal note, whether GoTonemas, has the GoTonemas experienced any of the boost from those activities, whether you're planning to, you know, do you have any connection with the access to that upcoming infrastructure, right? And the second one, maybe for everyone, after we get Jacob's perspective on how do you see the actual startup founders benefiting from that, from those activities. But let's go to Jacob. Let's hear his story and then go for another round. Yeah, thank you very much. So we have not been involved in any of these sort of like pan-European projects or any of these sort of like larger scales, sort of like HPCs. We have been a part of the GFion project here in Denmark, but have not been a part of the more pan-European projects. I think there is a huge potential here. So I think it's actually more than us not being aware of all of this. And that's also, of course, a sort of like a thing that we need to work about in terms of the communication and information about these different projects. And also, I think it's an area that is currently being developed. And I think the huge sort of like question here, which I don't know if there's an answer to, is also like, okay, how is this going to sort of like be commercialized? So what is going to be the business model here? And that is a huge question that I hear from a lot of these things when you have these public HPCs, where you say like, okay, somehow we need to generate some revenue to keep it running and all of these different things. But we also want, on the other hand, that it is to the sort of like benefit of the startup community and to the researchers and so on and so on. So I think one of the big questions here is like, how is this going to be financed in the future? Do I need to go out and have the VCs come with money to me to do this? That is going to be an additional risk. And we all know that when you're talking to VCs, you want to de-risk things. Or is it going to be public? Is it going to be that sort of like the European Union or whoever is going to sort of like put out grants for you to apply for a specific time and so on and so forth? And how is this going to be sort of like assessed and so on and so forth? I think there's a huge question mark there if you are a startup founder in terms of how do I get access to these resources? Because if I need to put down those 100,000 of heroes to be able to train a specific model on these sort of like infrastructures, then it's going to be very hard for me to convince Samantha necessarily that you need to give me the money. That's true. More questions, more questions and more complexity. So good. But, you know, we only have a limited time, right? We only can do within the framework of this panel. All we can do is maybe what I want to ask all of you to each and every one of you to do is assuming that there might be in the audience the founders of current, maybe the future unicorns and European champions. So what would be the one piece of advice that you would give to those founders who might be listening to us right now in keeping in mind that, you know, we all agree that for early stage startups, we're doing a good job, right? What would be your advice then to those companies that are not yet there that want to be a unicorn, that want to be the next billion, trillion market champion? One or maybe two things that you would give as an advice to their CEO or CTO who is listening. Starting with Jacob, then Philip, Samantha and Stefan. Yeah, thank you very much. So, so, so, so one, I would say go vertical. I I'm completely aligned with where I think a lot of the people here on the, on this, this panel that, that the value is going to lie in the vertical applications. So, so there will be some sort of like bigger institutions that will develop the foundational sort of like bigger foundational models, but then you need to go in and distill that into your vertical foundational model that will go in and solve a specific specific problem, a specific issue for, for your customers. Being either in the B2C or in the B2B space, you need to figure out like, what is the pain point? What is the pain that you will solve for these sort of like customers you have and go in and then figure out, okay, how are we going to do this in the most efficient way? Because as we also know, the, the big sort of like unknown about the AI revolution that we're in is how are we also going to, to power up all of this? As we, as we big, big, bigger and bigger models, bigger and bigger, sort of like data centers and so on. But we need to, to power this and figuring out a efficient way to solving a specific vertical problem. That is going to be key as you, as you are developing your, your next unicorn. Yeah. Yeah. Excellent points. Two additional points. Number one, very short. Start now, start today. Don't wait. Time is, clock is ticking very fast. Point number two is conduct your market validation from day one. Don't over engineer your solutions. And most importantly, focus on a specific pain points that your potential clients have. And also as early as possible, calculate the ROI, which, which you can always, which your solution has, talk to your customers and convince them as early as possible. So maybe to, I don't want to rephrase, but the way we're doing this at Alaya and I guess at every single fund that you're reinvesting in company and investing at a scaling stage. What we're looking at is, is there anyone else that bets on the company? Is there a talent? So senior recruiting, international ones and so on. Is there a client? Someone has put money, a dime and has secured kind of the pricing model of the company to say, okay, I want this product. I need this product for this and this reason. Collaboration with, with corporates. We were talking about this. Is there a pharma? Is there a bank? Is there an industrial player that has co-developed AI product with the company that helped the company to put and set their expertise? Because often industrial players, the lack of internal expertise on this and so on. So our way of thinking and our way of assessing a scaling company is making sure that someone else, will it be a recruitment, a talent, will it be a client? Will it be a corporate, a strategic? Has bet as well as we will do it. So maybe it summarizes a bit what Jacob and Philippa just said, meaning that at some point we have to see the essence of what the company has been built and has a first check box of is someone else has bet as well as we will do. And then we go for it. So, yes, my, my number one recommendation is making sure that someone else before asking a lot of money to an investment fund, making sure that there is people that wants to work with you. So talent international, there is a client that said, I need it. And this is product market fit that Philippa were talking about. And there is a corporate that said, yeah, I need to call develop this because I'm lagging behind in terms of internal expertise and I need you. Right. So this is what the way we ask the same thing. So this is what I recommend. And on my side, I'm not an expert of funding, but I will perhaps say to the VC, don't be shy or invest in Europe. We have a process, most vibrant ecosystem in the world for AI and beyond. I will say also don't hear the sirens or the mermaids. We can do better with one tenth of the budget. We're not able to, we're not obliged to take a machine gun for killing a fly. Sometimes we can do smarter with small models with something different that prosperity and AI. We can do something different for a smaller problem. We're not obliged every time to use a one trillion parameter model for running a specific problem. So I really believe on this smart approach. I really believe on open source. I really believe on small models. I really believe on the quality of data. So the war is not over. It's just starting. And I think I'm a really strong European believer. We have all the advantage for us. Let's be united. And for the VC, let's trust a bit more in Europe. I think we can, we can all, we can all clap to that Philip. So I was just, it was just going to, you know, thumb up the, that, that last point by Stefan. And, and to sum it up, I think we, we actually provided a few interesting, at the very least, you know, thought provoking ideas. And at best maybe, you know, we would actually move someone who is here in the panel, who is listening to, to go quick, to go vertical, right? Go open source and, and to, to lobby our, our European and national ecosystems to, to stand united and to provide, provide that and build on that unique advantage that we have in Europe. The, the access to the data, access to infrastructure that we're trying to, to provide to the scale ups, to help them compete against the big bucks. But anyways, it's been my absolute pleasure having, and hosting that panel, having you all as panelists. I want to, unfortunately the time is up. So I want to thank all of you. I want to thank the audience for being with us. And yeah, I, I would really love to go back next year and, and have a follow up discussion, but that really depends on, on you guys. And that said, I would probably call it a day. Thank you all. Have a great rest of the GTC and a great rest of the day. Bye bye. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thanks a lot. Bye bye.
