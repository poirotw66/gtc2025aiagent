 Robo-taxis will not be robot only for at least another 10 years, probably more. So the hidden human driver powering the robot taxi is absolutely critical. I will shed light on this hidden human driver in this talk. For the next 30 odd minutes, you're going to learn about how remote driving is a different approach to driverless mobility, how real world applications of remote driving are delivering impact today, and how remote driving can complement autonomy to accelerate the deployment of affordable autonomous mobility solutions. Do please feel free to ask questions in the chat as we go along. Happy to answer them at any time. Before we jump in though, I do want to take the chance to just briefly introduce myself and the company I work for. So my name is Esther. As you've probably already figured from my accent, I'm German based in Munich. Today I'm head of business development at VEI Technology. I have a background in business and product, and now for the past three years have had the pleasure of joining VEI on its quite remarkable journey of growth and world-first milestones across both Europe and the US. VEI has been founded in 2018 to revolutionize urban mobility through remote driving to make cities greener and safer. Key milestones that we've achieved along the way that we're quite proud of include, for example, being the first ones ever to drive on European public roads with no one in the car. We did this already back in 2023 in Hamburg, Germany, arguably under the world's strictest road regulations. So the fact that we were able to do it there gives us great confidence we will be able to do it essentially anywhere in the world. Another key milestone that we're very proud of that I would like to call out is that we launched a commercial driverless service in Las Vegas at the beginning of 2024. And that service is seeing great traction, receiving raving customer reviews, and has a net promoter score of 65. And of course, all of this wouldn't have been possible without the 140 million in funding that we raised from renowned investors across both Europe and the US. And of course, first and foremost, the exceptional team of over 150 people, the majority of whom are engineers from the widest variety of engineering disciplines you can imagine, combining that German automotive engineering all the way with Silicon Valley software engineering. So, all right, enough with introductions. Let's jump in. What is remote driving? So in remote driving, the car is controlled by a human, not a robot. But that human is physically decoupled from the car. So the human can actually be hundreds or even thousands of miles away from the vehicle. And the driver who remotely controls that vehicle sits in what we call a telestation, which is essentially a replica of the driver's cabin with automotive grade steering wheel, gas, brake pedal, and essentially all the secondary controls you would know from a standard car, such as lights, wipers, et cetera. And very importantly, part of that telestation are three monitors, which are in front of the driver, where the driver sees a real-time 360-degree video stream of the car's surroundings to get the same situational awareness that any conventional driver would have. And now a lot of VAI's magic actually lies in this highly dependable real-time transmission of both video and controls between the telestation and the vehicle. Now, in the process of having built this technology from the ground up, VAI has become the holder of 19 patents covering tremendous IP ranging all the way from networking to safety concept to user interface innovations and much more. And all of which, of course, is required to make this technology come to life and make it safe and roadworthy for public streets. Now, for the technical among you, I am happy to zoom in one level more on the tech behind remote driving. So what you see on the slide is a very high-level view of the teledriving architecture. And you will notice that the beauty of that stack is it's actually comparatively simple, right? So it only requires four cameras, two antennas and routers, and some compute. But very importantly, that is nowhere as much compute as you would need for an autonomous vehicle. The part of the stack that I want to spend a little bit of time double-clicking on is actually the connectivity stack here. So the reason I want to do that is because connectivity is the part where people tend to raise concerns about the feasibility of remote driving, just in fear of high latency or even connectivity losses. And I want to share a few insights and stats about how our system performs and how we've built safety into the system. So the first point I want to call out is the topic of redundancy. So what we do is we drive on two SIM cards where we intelligently route traffic to be up and downloaded on the fastest connection at any time. So we actually select the best two out of four available mobile network operators every 10 milliseconds. A lot of IP that we have at VAY lies in how we prioritize and package that traffic for up and download. Fun fact, we actually were initially running on four SIM cards. But after careful analysis and then, of course, also further optimization of our system, we found that two cards are actually completely sufficient for redundancy, which allowed us to essentially cut data cost in half just, yeah, almost overnight. The second concept I would like to call out is the topic of minimal risk maneuver. So we call it MRM, minimal risk maneuver. And this is when the end-to-end latency exceeds 300 milliseconds, which is the threshold that is deemed safe for remote driving. When this happens, the vehicle automatically triggers a braking maneuver. And this braking initially is gradual deceleration. But then if latency persists, a harsh brake is initiated. Now, this very, very rarely happens because the system, the latency in our system actually stays below 300 milliseconds 99.9% of the time. Because the latency in our system is so consistently low, we are actually able to drive on roads up to 35 miles per hour, which truly is what sets us apart from most other players in this space who tend to focus more on low speed use cases or actually still drive with safety driver for that matter. The third concept relating to connectivity in our system that I want to call out is the concept of distance between telestation and vehicle. Because we get this question a lot. How far can the teledriver be from the vehicle that he or she is controlling? Well, the furthest we've done at Vey so far was 6,000 kilometers round trip or 4,000 miles, which happened during Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, where we actually remotely controlled a car in Berlin from Barcelona. And the signal was routed via Stockholm in Sweden. So, yeah, from the pure technical point of view, we actually feel super confident that we solved the connectivity challenge to an extent that even large distances between vehicle and driver are absolutely possible. And now the last fun fact about connectivity that I want to leave you with is relating to Starlink. So, we're actually the only company in the world that is able to teledrive using Starlink only. This has been especially relevant for our B2B partnerships, where we operate in very remote locations. Yeah, it wasn't at all trivial to get this to work because while Starlink is very much known for super strong coverage, it's less known for its stability, particularly for real-time operations like we have with remote driving. And so, yeah, our engineering team had a blast cracking that challenge. And, yeah, now we're very proud to call ourselves the only company to teledrive using Starlink only. So, yeah, we're very proud to call ourselves the only company to teledrive using Starlink. It actually takes us only a couple of hours in our almost 10,000 square meter large production facility that we have in Las Vegas to bring up a new vehicle with our stack on it. So, while all of this process is already highly efficient, it is even more efficient when the technology is already integrated on the OEM's production line. Because then what they can do is we can integrate with the existing vehicle sensors and architecture, which further reduces the cost of the system and actually brings it to below $1,000 per vehicle. Now, at that price point, you're getting actually a 20x cheaper system than what you would get with a full autonomy stack. Which, of course, now might get you wondering about the real-world applications of this technology, right? So, at VEI, we actually built this technology from the ground up with the very clear mission in mind that we wanted to build the most affordable door-to-door service that provides a true alternative to private car ownership. And after roughly five years of development, that's exactly what we did in Las Vegas at the beginning of 2024. We launched a direct-to-consumer offering that we call VEI Drive. And how it works is you click a button, get a car. So, you order, we bring you the car, you get in, you drive yourself. And then once you arrive, we take the car away. So, you don't need to walk to the car and you don't need to park the car. Which, of course, means you actually get the very same door-to-door convenience that RideHale can offer. But because you drive yourself, we can offer it at half the price. We launched this service in 2024 in Las Vegas. And since then, are very proud to have achieved roughly 10,000 trips. Covering a geofence of almost twice the size of San Francisco. And that geofence notably includes any and every high complex maneuver you can imagine. Of course, there's roundabouts, but there's also busy hotel entrances on the strip. There's animals on the street. Like, you name it, we've seen it. And, yeah, because of the great success that we've seen, we're now getting ready to scale up the fleet to 100 vehicles by the middle of this year. And importantly, at that scale, that will already be sufficient to show break-even on unit economics. And once we have achieved that, we will be ready to launch a second city in the U.S. as well. Now, as I mentioned, we very much built this technology with the goal in mind to launch that consumer service that today we have live in Las Vegas. But ever since actually putting this technology out on the road on public streets and the world seeing the impact of this technology come to life, we received massive interest from all sorts of industries inbound, which include car rental, logistics, off-road, private vehicles. And now from a business development point of view, that created some very interesting opportunities to actually productize our technology in different ways. So today, we're now able to offer a variety of different operating models that range sort of all the way from they acting as the technology provider, where we let the customer own the operations. And we just provide the technology and we charge a licensing fee for that technology, all the way to they acting as a full service provider, where essentially the customer just sends us a trip request and we take care of all the rest, in which case we then charge by the tele-driven minute or mile. Now, of course, in the background, from a technical point of view, this created some very interesting challenges around modularizing our technology in a way such that today, our tech actually works plug and play with different vehicle platforms, and also different mobility service platforms. So that over the past two years, we've been able to bring our tech up on a variety of platforms, which never took us more than two to four weeks. And actually, we have one customer in the AV trucking space, for whom we brought our technology onto a 40-ton truck within less than a month. And now, together with that customer, we're running commercial operations. So yeah, all in all, it's been a very exciting journey, and I'm sure it will continue to be. But of course, when we look ahead into the future, a question that we face a lot is, what about autonomy? So isn't remote driving just a bridge that will no longer be needed once autonomy is finally here? And this is exactly the question that I would like to get into in this second half of the talk. And spoiler alert, VEI's perspective is that remote driving is actually an accelerator for the adoption of autonomy. And the reason we say that is, well, because the future with level five autonomy, so no human involvement whatsoever, is well over 10 years out. But we don't have to just sit and wait until that time comes. We can actually use remote driving to complement autonomy, where it isn't ready yet, to have a fully functioning end-to-end driverless product today. And that's a concept that we at VEI call assisted autonomy. Now, what assisted autonomy is all about is breaking down the autonomy problem into easy and difficult-to-solve parts, where then the autonomy handles the easy parts, and the human handles the difficult parts. In that way, then, the human fulfills two functions. The first one is the human acting as a backup. So that's really the remote driver stepping in when the autonomy fails. So when it doesn't know how to handle a certain scenario in its dedicated operational design domain, or ODD. And the second function that the human fulfills is the function of expansion. So that's where the driver expands the autonomous ODD to create more meaningful geofences and applications. And now, to make this whole concept really come to life, what you need to do is you need to seamlessly integrate the autonomy and remote driving for a solution, where handoffs between the two systems become completely unnoticeable to the passenger. Because this way, you can actually create this guaranteed eyes-off, hands-off experience for the entire journey, where then the passenger can fully disengage, sleep, drink, you name it, just enjoy the full benefits of autonomy. Now, again, for the more technical among you, I'm happy to chat a little bit more about the tech stack required behind to make this work. So in the bar chart on the left on the slide, you see the illustrative sort of gradual approach from teledriving only to assisted autonomy, where first the teledriver acts as the safety driver to the level two autonomy, and then later can act as the fallback driver to a level three autonomy. Just one brief word on the 70-30 split that's shown on the slide here. Please do take this with a grain of salt. It's illustrative because it will differ massively from use case to use case. Just think truck versus private vehicle, how different, yeah, the routes will be, and therefore also that split will be. So really the core concept that I want to convey here is this gradual transition to work towards the integration of teledriver and level three autonomy. And importantly, the end goal here really is and has to be level three autonomy. So hands off, eyes off, because only once you have that maturity of the autonomous system, the teledriver can actually assist other vehicles while the autonomy is engaged. And that then creates this ratio of 10 or later maybe 20 to one vehicle to driver, which becomes truly economical. Now, when you think about this in practice, when you combine teledriver with a level three system for highway driving, that actually already works perfectly today. So this is exactly what we do with the AV trucking customer that I mentioned earlier. We have a deployment where we do autonomous trucking on the highway and use teledriver from and to the depot. So we use teledriver to close the loop. However, now when you think about urban driving, it's a different story, right? Because no urban level three ready system exists today. But the beauty of assisted teledriver is that it can actually help accelerate the path to that urban level three system. Because what you can do is you intentionally use the teledriver for complex maneuvers and thereby reduce the requirements towards the autonomous system. So, for example, you exclude roundabouts, unprotected left turns and other complex maneuvers, which then essentially reduces the requirements of all the maneuvers that the autonomy has to cover. And because of these reduced requirements, the cost of building that system comes down significantly. There's a couple of factors that contribute to that. A few I want to call out are firstly the sensor and compute. So, given the autonomy does not need to handle every edge case and every maneuver, it does not require as extensive and as expensive of a sensor and consequently compute set. So, for example, it can actually get by without a 360 degree LIDAR. The second cost driver here is validation. So, given the autonomy's ODD is more limited, the number of scenarios to simulate and validate drops, which again reduces validation and certification cost. And the third driver to mention here is the R&D cost and also timeline. Because the autonomy's ODD can actually be gradually extended with the teledriver acting as safety driver where needed. That makes it possible to validate the technology as part of ongoing commercial operations. Now, all of this taken together ultimately reduces both the cost and the time to market for autonomy significantly. And because of that, assisted autonomy actually makes autonomy accessible to a much wider variety of applications, which then includes but isn't limited to robotaxis. One such application that I want to highlight here just as an example, because I'm personally particularly excited about it, is the use of assisted autonomy in private vehicles. So, when you combine today's available Level 3 systems for autonomy on highways, such as the one you have in the Mercedes S-Class, the highway pilot, you combine that with teledriving to drive the car from the door onto the highway and then from the highway to the destination, what you get is a seamless door-to-door experience where the driver can fully disengage all the way. And that, of course, then makes all the difference between being able to relax for, say, a couple of minutes in the driver's seat versus potentially sleeping all the way in the back seat. But that's, of course, just one example. There is many other use cases for assisted autonomy as well. So, for example, the one I already touched upon earlier, the trucking where you use teledriving to unlock these hub-to-hub driverless operations, which is what we're doing today with a commercial customer. There's also military operations where we've gotten some inbound interest for assisted autonomy. And again, also there is use for this in robotaxis to accelerate the deployment and reduce the cost of operations. Yeah, so that actually just leaves me with the recap. So to sum things up, what we've covered today, first of all, fully autonomous vehicles, level five, are not ready in here yet. We think they're still a decade out. But there is a solution that works today. And that solution is remote driving, where remote driving unlocks driverless mobility benefits at rational costs already today. A prime example of this technology life in action is VEI's car share service in Las Vegas. And after covering that in the second half of the talk, we then looked forward into the autonomous future, where we addressed the relationship of remote driving and autonomy and established that teledriving is more than a bridge to autonomy, that it actually helps accelerating the adoption of autonomy and can make it available today, where remote driving and autonomy integrate seamlessly, which lowers costs, accelerates deployment, and expands uses for autonomy today. Thanks a lot for your time. I hope you learned something interesting and look forward to connecting for feedback or any further questions.
