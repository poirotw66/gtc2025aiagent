Thank you so much for joining me today and sharing your insights and experience. To kick off things softly, let's say, I want to start with a couple of icebreaker questions just to get the conversation flowing and get everyone nice and comfortable. And maybe I'll start with you, Michal, with what is one piece of health tech you wish existed today that does not exist yet? It's a really good question because I really think most of the things I wish for actually do exist. They just don't exist inside the healthcare arena yet. And there's a lot of barriers for them to actually enter into this arena. But the tools themselves, I think, where my imagination goes, most of it is already there. And it's time for us to embrace it and to make use of it, because it is going to change the way we do medicine to a much better world, hopefully. All right. Maybe Simon, what is the one piece of health that you wish exists today? Simon, what is the one piece of health that you wish to be? So I think the most exciting area currently is brain computer interface. And as we think about a world of large language models in the future and the ability of that model to sit alongside us and augment our intelligence, the missing link then is how you engage that directly to your brain. And we have at Imperial two spin outs, one called Mint Neurotech, that is a fully invasive device to connect to the brain. And then another called Cogitat that is doing EEG brainwave decoding. And for me, these are really transformative technologies that align very well with the progress that we see with LLMs. Absolutely. That's fantastic. Yeah. Maybe Lars, I'm gonna go with a different question for you. What's one word that will define digital health this year, 2025? Well, that's tricky one to change the question here. And I think that first of all, I think that hopefully, real impact. That's two words here. You can make a hyphen in between. I think that back to the barriers here inside the healthcare and the capabilities of what we are capable of doing. I think that we're, I think that this is the year where we're going to see that the AI solutions are going to be integrated into many more workflows. And I think that the barriers are slowly but steadily getting evaporated. So I think that I'm really, really looking forward to first and foremost, on the patient safety component, increasing patient safety. Next, the administrative burden that we're seeing across healthcare. And thirdly, we're also seeing healthcare getting paid for for the, for the interventions that they do, that really see impact in those three pain points. I think that we see some of them, some of the impacts of course on the, on the, on the administrative burden, like basically back to automated documentation, where we still need to see more impact on the patient safety and even more impact on the administrative burden. And lastly, also on the side of the, when you cycle management. So real impact. Real impact. Awesome. Farnaz, for you, what would that word be that defines digital health in 2025? Yeah. And that's a very tricky question to decide on. I think there are quite few keywords. In my opinion, the first and foremost is interoperability. Although it may seem a bit obvious, but having that capability that we can have that seamless integration and talk of different platforms within healthcare systems, devices, and monitoring systems, and creating that seamless data transfer between all of these different technologies and capabilities that will evolve will be quite key. And especially as we're seeing healthcare moving towards a more digitized and decentralized framework, having that interoperability, I think would be quite key to not only enable us have that safe and efficient and seamless data sharing across variable platforms and vehicles that exist, but also to be able to further develop predictive and proactive AI algorithms and be able to drive insight from them. So I think having that enabler and that foundation would be key moving forward. Absolutely. And I think there's no healthcare talk that does not talk about that. The silos we've built across different departments and ecosystems, right? Interoperability is definitely a key word. Maybe one more question for all four of you. And that is, what industry can healthcare or digital health learn from? And I'll start with you, Michalik. And what's the industry that healthcare can learn something from? Well, I think we're having had many years involvement in studying from aviation to risk management. I think it's a good way of learning things, how to automate things and how to make things safer. But also, I think one big issue that we have in healthcare is waste. We have a lot of waste in healthcare. And maybe, I don't know what area is moving a lot faster than we are, but hopefully energy and things that are involved in saving energy might actually help us. But we can learn from everyone. We are so behind and there's so many issues we need to solve. And we are so ready. And yes, we need to learn from everyone. Excellent. Simon, what's your number one industry to learn from? I have two. So the first is the tech industry generally. So I was reading an article from one of our professors, Erko Auteo, about the role hugging faces played across the tech industry in being this open source development and standard that enables interoperability across lots of different platforms. So I think there's an opportunity there for health to learn from the tech industry more generally. And then my second one is banks. So just thinking about the importance of trust in data and who do we trust with our most precious information and assets. And it probably is banks and financial services in some settings. So the banks have done some things right in order to engender the trust amongst the public. Absolutely. Absolutely. Two good industries. Lars, what would be your number one industry? Yeah, I think I agree very much with the others here. But I think that the consumer software industries right now, we have a lot of doctors, a lot of nurses, and they didn't choose their trade because they love technology. Like I chose my trade. So and they're sitting in front of a lot of users facing a lot of software that is that is they're just difficult to use. And some of it is older, etc. And it takes time to implement. It takes time to make feature requests and see that change in the system. And I think that some of the users that we're talking to, they're a little bit baffled with the fact that they use Netflix in the weekend, and then they get into work, and then it becomes so complicated to actually use their software and in the Monday, right. And then so I think that we need to learn about about really meeting the end users, they're expert end users, they have high requirements and all of that. But it's, yeah, the software industry as a whole also need to to meet those requirements and and and and make rapid changes that that that makes usability and use experiences better. Absolutely. I think that's a that's an answer that for us probably really appreciates, right? For us, what's your industry you think we should learn the most from? So just to add to what everyone said, and I think it's quite valuable learning from each industry, I think there are bits and pieces that we could take. But from my end, and from our experience as a digital health solution and AI company, I think the gaming industry as a whole could be a great model to replicate and learn. learn from them. Reasons being is, they have worked amazingly in creating that user engagement as well, as well as behavioral design. What that means is, a lot of the times when we're introducing a software solution for the patients, we usually have difficulty in engaging them, personalizing the solution for them and ensuring that there's this adoption. And I think this applies to other parts of healthcare, whether it's about drug diagnostics and diagnostics and kind of engaging the patient and having that adoption. So first, that would be one area of kind of engaging user engagement, and also the data and personalization, I think in the gaming industry, we see that there is vast amount of data that they try to personalize the offerings, based on the users, which we could replicate again, in the healthcare industry, making sure that whether it's educational content, whether it's the patient treatment journey, that we're going to be able to do that. But what the kes той and what Esna Queen rend as well as power crew is to take advantage of What types of doctors Jesus, what types of medical work is to describe what might be a tool 기 Out This is it okay, Paourt that hasone expertise and we I think that a few excellent methods for the human rights under the extent of management of digital health. not regulated digital health solutions to the hands of the patients in a matter of minutes. So it's more cost effective, it tends time quicker and faster. Yes, and it will hopefully change the paradigm of how care is delivered. It dies beautifully into what I think Lars said earlier on making apps more accessible and giving that Netflix effect to physicians and clinicians and first line workers, giving them the opportunity to build their own apps. I think that's incredible that with just a short prompt, a physician or a nurse can create an app that is instantly usable by their patients, but also that it becomes user friendly and intuitive and allows people to use phones and their own devices just in such an incredible way. That's a beautiful use case. Lars, let me ask you that same question. I think at Court here doing some interesting work in delivering AI to our providers as well. Can you, you want to show us a brief demo as well? You want to talk briefly through how you are and the company are impacting the way care is delivered through AI? Yeah, I think so from our standpoint, AI has become so complicated and we can do so much with it. So we are focusing on providing AI solutions through what is called an API. Basically, you can plug in whatever application into our AI solutions and then you should hopefully get the highest accurate AI solution that you're asking for. And the AI systems that we're hosting are large language models, inside foundation models that could do a lot of beneficial things. Everything from, I think, the use case that people are very used to today is no generation. So basically that we can automatically document whatever is being said inside a dialogue. We can also help with the dictation. We do something called natural language dictation so that you can basically also as a healthcare practitioner, just in your natural language, dictate similar to what you were used to before, but much more in a free form. We have one that is very familiar with the radiologist use case here that is very much within that use case, most definitely. Then we have AI solutions for going into clinical knowledge. So clinical databases and so on, so that you can actually get the most important clinical knowledge as a doctor, as a nurse, and even as a patient, as such that when you start having the conversation, we can serve that information. Our big play as a company is, and that's why we were so very nicely on this panel. I believe that Dr. wasPast you showing the interface, and we are basically on the back end. So instead of using a large language model provider, such as OpenAI, or Entropic, and so forth, that can help you write your daughter's essay and should also help you with the medical related problems. We are focusing only on healthcare, so we're verticalized AI solutions and thereby we can have the opportunity to not be as good at at writing an essay, but much better at the healthcare related problems. So basically what I'm rambling about here is that I'm just gonna show you here, is that you can start building applications on top of our AI capabilities, right? So you can build a co-pilot that is having a lot of consultations. You can tap into those conversations either live, physically or via video, and we can transcribe that with a very, very high accuracy with all of the medical terminology in place and all that. And we can help you on putting that into a template, hence a clinical note. We can code it to whatever coding system that you would like us to code it to. And we can give you some prompts during the conversation that is related to evidence and also related to the source or the clinical information. This application is difficult to build if you don't have the AI system to really support it. And if you don't have the AI system with the right amount of accuracy. This API and this offering is then also easily integrated into the EHRs. We believe that back to having the right workflow and the right software, we believe that you need to integrate your solution as nice as possible into the workflow that the practitioners are building. And we do believe that we don't wanna be yet another software render that where you have to be trained in the interface and using that interface and all that. And we would much rather integrate seamless into the workflow that they are already using, whether it's radiology, risk pack systems, or whether it's the doctors that are sitting in front of the EHR, or whether it's a nurse that is sitting in front of a remote patient monitoring system. We wanna be the AI that is supporting all of those solutions. That's incredible. Absolutely. Thank you both for showing a brief glimpse at what your platforms each do. Wrapping up this question, and I don't wanna be negative, and I hope, Michal, you will show us some of the interesting things to come, but where is AI today falling short in the clinical practice? And maybe, Michal, you can give your perspective as a clinician on that. Yeah, I think a lot of things that are there are not being used in the, actually. And some of the things are actually have to do with the fact that assuming that we could keep on doing the same workflow that we are doing now and use the modern tools is actually not the right way of looking at it. We do need to change the way we work. We need to change the workflow. And there is a revolution that needs to take place. And I'll just give you one simple example which covers it. For example, the AI that is now reading mammography. This is my field, so I'm very much acquainted with that. This AI now could tell you the risk of every person to have cancer. And in fact, it seems that this risk assessment is the best, better than genetics and various other ways. We're trying to look at it from various angles. However, if you want to be using it, you need to change the way you do things. You cannot continue calling the women every two years to do mammography because they've reached the age. They need to change. And things need to change. And the system needs to change. And it needs to be amended. And there is a revolution that needs to take place if we want the ability that we have now to be active and to try to stop all the waste we're doing. And we're doing so much waste in medicine. There's just no word to describe it on the one side. And on the other side, we are falling short in a lot of things that we do have solutions for and we're not offering it to the right people. So what I think is that all of the new innovation that is coming, which is amazing, needs to be further involved in the management teams of various hospitals, much the same way as maybe is happening with Imperial College and the hospitals they're working with. And I'm sure this helps the right people to take the right decision and make the right choice to change things. So no, we cannot think that we would work the same way we're working now, use AI and get them better results. It's not good enough. So this is where we're falling short. That's an incredible answer. I mean, there's a lot to unpack there. And one of the things I'm hearing is, right, it's not so much that we're falling short on the technology aspect. It's we're falling short on being able to change and adjusting our procedures and the way we work with the tools we have at hand. And I mean, there is, in technology, there's very much a tech positivity about AI will solve this and AI will take away this work from me, right, like writing a paper for school. Who writes it himself anymore, right? You just ask ChatGPT or one of the other language models to write that for you. So I'm wondering how is this atmosphere in hospitals regarding this AI will solve it? What are clinicians and nurses and what is the field, the end users thinking about that? And let me start with you, Simon, on the perspective you have on that within Imperial College and the hospitals you work with. how is that atmosphere on innovation and is there maybe, are physicians afraid of losing work to AI? Are they excited? How are people looking at this AI will solve it attitude that some of us tech people have? I think there's a huge excitement. I don't think I've heard a physician talk about how they're afraid that they will be replaced by AI. I really, I cannot see that happening and I don't get a sense of that. So I do get a feeling that individual clinicians are very excited about the kind of tools that are coming to them. And I sense a frustration as well of just about how long it takes to actually get there. And I think the adoption of health technologies into hospital systems is a bit of an art form is my sense. So there are many programs and interventions that have been tried to accelerate this and still it seems it's very hard. We have that in Imperial because we are a generator of new discoveries. So we are very much a technology push in terms of our modality. We create about 40 companies a year across our staff and our students. And so it's, in my mind, we need to be asking more questions around how do we get these adopted? What do the customers, what do the physicians actually think about these kinds of technologies? And we do have programs now that enable this interaction to happen so we get the voice of that customer into the conversation much earlier. But I also hear that in spite of how difficult it might be to adopt a technology, physicians are smart, right? And they are already leveraging tools off-grid in a way. Perhaps it's simple messaging platforms that help them to shorten the waiting times on the theaters for surgery. So, you know, they find a way. They are very entrepreneurial. Absolutely. Couldn't agree more. This atmosphere of adopting new apps, right? we always like to think, again, from a technology point of view, putting on my tech glasses, right? We look at these solutions as in, well, they're going to solve this burden we have on physicians, this reduced clinician burnout. Maybe, Lars, what's your take on that? And are these novel apps, right, the thing you and the Corti team do, how is that impacting this phenomenon of clinician burnout and how do we reduce that with these new digital innovations? Yeah, I think, so I think that I agree on the field, of course, need to adapt new technology faster, but from the technology perspective, I think the technology also have a long way to go, right? So when we look at the models right now, just for the clinical node documentation, we can see with our models as compared to out of the box like chat GPT kind of models that we can improve so much more and we keep on improving every week, right? So I think that in terms of alleviating the administrative burnout, that's one thing, like time saved in terms of documentation burden, all of that, that's real and we can do that with the large language models, but also there is a huge improvement to be done on the AI side that we're seeing in the early day and we keep on improving and we keep on learning that we can also improve our own system, right? So that is giving you an insight into how much more there is to do. I think that everyone that has tried to use chat GPT a lot, they first of all come with this, wow, that was amazing. This can solve everything and when you start using it in the early day, then you find out it's not that smart and I think that that's fine, that's all good, right? As long as you can do a real job for you, then it's okay that it's not that smart in the most complicated situations, but let's be real, it needs to be even smarter than what we see out of the box today. Then we come into patient safety, things like that when you actually have an expert clinician that needs some advice similar to Dr. Mikhail, your example here on the mammography is real, right? I think that the image segmentation and all of those models that has been the biggest breakthrough and that was a little bit sooner since the breakthrough in 2012 on the image classification models until 2016 when you saw these big image segmentation models come in to play. We've seen like a lot of innovation in radiology. We are still to see a lot of innovation in the text and audio space of the patient safety component. That's one place where we're seeing like an endless amount of possibilities in terms of where we could actually improve because if you tap into the live dialogue between the patient and the doctor and all of that and if you can actually come with some useful advice, some intelligent advice during that conversation then you're becoming that partner, that colleague to the physician and remember the physician is so busy and they don't have that colleague at hand, right? Because the other colleague is also so busy so if they can start really tapping into the AI capabilities, sometimes I'm dumbing it down and saying it's just like it's a live Google specialized search engine that is sitting there next to you and can actually extract the vital information when you need it the most, right? That kind of ability is something that we're really, really excited about keeping on improving on. Absolutely. Absolutely. Major difference for clinicians and for us, your point of view on how you and the team are reducing this clinician burnout and this overburden of let's say over-documenting things, right? I think there's so much notes being taken, so much being tracked and I think your word of optimism earlier was integration, right? How does the Huma ecosystem or the platform help with tying things together, getting to that point of integrating and effectively reducing the workload on our clinicians? That's a great point and we have experienced that first then as a software technology company that there are so many apps nurses, nurses, physicians are dealing with different solutions and as it was mentioned by the other panelists, yes, there is a huge burden on burnout and there's also resilience in adopting new solutions. So at Huma, what we've done is to make it easier for them. Again, we have leveraged our AI and LLM solutions in order to be a support for the nurses and help them become faster and quicker and what we've done which I'm going to show you is a partnership that we started a year ago, roughly a year ago with Google which we called it the 10x nurse and this initiative, what it simply does as it states the 10x nurse, it enables a nurse to be monitoring and looking over 10x the number of patients that they usually can do and that happens by us streamlining and optimizing the processes using AI to generate let's say a summary of the report of a patient using their different visits with the doctor, their different medications, their different vital signs and what we've done which I'm going to show you is as I showed you we have a patient facing app and together on this call we managed to configure a patient facing app for diabetes patients and through that app which gets connected to external devices we start collecting different vital signs let's say it's either the symptoms, the peak flows, the air quality, the patient heart rate and all that information and data will be shared with the clinician and the nurses, the GPs through this dashboard which is called the clinician dashboard and as you can see there are different color codes here which is our RAC threshold red, amber, green and once we're designing the app and building the app we define different thresholds for each of the vital signs and if a patient experiences let's say high peak flow or high blood pressure they will be categorized as red they will be flagged and accelerated and brought to the attention of the nurses so that the nurse can let's say go to the patient profile as you can see you know take a look at all the different vitals that are being tracked and monitored overlay the different data points that they want to see whether it's you know the respiratory rate their sleep their heart rate so they can overlay and have an overview of what the patient is going through and now they can call the patient if they want to communicate anything with the patient the patient is at risk they can easily send a message to the patient and they can export the data if they want to they can send the questionnaire and what they can do is if you see here if there is a red flag and they want to resolve it we have this generate note which is AI enabled and it will save the nurse so much time that they don't have to go through all the previous data points and the patient history their medical history the medication that they're going through but using this AI algorithm they will get a summary of what the patient is experiencing you know what were their history and all that and they can either resolve the flag or reach out to the patient so this will save them a lot of time at the same time as I said they have different capabilities of let's say they want to call the patient because it's urgent I can allow it to do start calling the patient or scheduling appointment with the patient and sending the messages and notes but overall as I said using this AI capability that we have introduced we've managed to save the nurses and the optimizing through optimizing the clinician workflow we have managed to not only have cost saving but also enable them to be optimized and have better visibility on the patient status and medical history and be able to effectively make decisions for the patient wow impressive this really shows how an app generated by a single line right has this entire backend to communicate with your physicians and integrate and generate notes I know I'm not a big fan of note-taking I can imagine as a physician if you see what 20, 30, 40 patients a day and you have to write a similar text every time distill that knowledge that is a huge time saver now that brings me to our second major topic in a way of today which is scaling your startup right because there are many startups that have these incredible ideas of generating reports or using voice in an ambient setting or there is incredible technology being developed but it is about how can we get that in that clinical practice right and I would like to have your view on that Michal on the expertise you have through RISE and the innovation hub you led how do you advise startups when they are in their early days they are developing their product they are developing their initial MVP what is the advice you would give them on preparing them to get into that clinical context and making that actual change to both physicians but also us one of the tricks of the trade is to identify doctors who are curious and who are good partners and there are a lot of those and in fact some of them actually when they get into the hospital when they're in a new position the first thing they look for is the innovation center in order to find who to work with and how to get involved so these are good people to start up with obviously they do not really represent the whole generation and if they like something it doesn't mean that all the doctors are going to adopt it and in fact you need to find various different kind of profile but it's a good way to start and listening to doctors from the beginning is really part of the traits I think also a lot of time when we hear a new startup we're looking for something that would be unique to them and some kind of an originality in the solution which I don't know if it's true in the fact that it is going to make a difference but for us it does and so the way they present the solution has to do with this shiny thing that they need to show or the shiny trick that they do and that might be a use case that they choose it might be starting small and scaling afterwards and a lot of time this beginning is really crucial and it's something that you feel in the air I cannot even tell you what it is but I do know that when you see it you see it and you see that the people that are there they're curious they're caring they are looking for a real problem and a real solution and you know matching matchmaking this meeting the right doctors on the other side is really very crucial in the beginning at least absolutely and that brings me to you maybe Simon on that matchmaking that finding the right physician that can sponsor that startup or just helping startups find that specialty that thing they solve how do you at Imperial and with the team how do you help startups find that balance between this cool technology they develop and the actual use case in the clinical practice we do quite a lot around that and I'll come back to that in a second but I wanted to pick up on some of Michal's points on the role of key opinion leaders if you like and actually Cedric the point you made that they are a sponsor and in some organisations the sponsor will get you all the way there but in other organisations they really won't and you need to be speaking to the customer more broadly and just understanding for example how would this technology be procured is it going to go direct are you best working with a distributor in some cases are you best working with a tier one medical technology supplier that could then sell on to the hospital so sort of understanding the value chain I think is key to that and then another aspect is moving from the kind of startup world where everything's kind of informal and fast to the regulated world of healthcare and so one of the things we work with our startups on is their quality management systems so actually having a QMS in place is a critical step whenever it comes to the clinical trial part of the technology it's one of the mechanistic things that the regulator will look for and most startups I would say do not start out in the right way in order to align to the regulatory requirements around things like ISO 13485 so we work with our startups to put in some of those mechanistic elements and we ask them also to think about things like health economics and so okay it's a great discovery but actually how much money is it going to help the hospital save over its lifetime so I think there's quite a lot there around helping the founders in terms of how we help them connect we run lots of different programs across all of our communities some around students some around postdoc researchers that enable conversations to happen between the inventors if you like and the clinicians and we run hackathons for example so we did one recently on how could AI agents be used to really think about vaccines and sort of society's general reluctance to use vaccines and how can we overcome that reluctance using AI agents as an example so I think universities are great conveners of different stakeholders in the ecosystem thanks Simon absolutely these hackathons for vaccine adoption seem like a great way of helping startups find their thing Lars being co-founder of Cordy what were the type of things that helped you scale in the early days were it hackathons were it early partnerships what were the key things to help you and the team scale in those first years at Cordy yeah so so first of all as we all know right now that machine learning has moved so fast recently right we started in 2016 we are approximately 150 mostly engineers in the company machine learning engineers they're sitting there and back in 2016 we needed to prove whether we were even able to first and foremost understand a live conversation in real time in order to give real time feedback that was our first research thesis for our company I came from doing a lot of machinery methodology research and I've made a lot of papers within that I still cherish research a lot and we actually did research to begin with so we started out as a research lab we even called ourselves Cordy labs to begin with and the first two years we went directly into choosing a use case within healthcare where we could prove this to happen so back to what Dr. Michal said here we found some collaborators we found them in the Danish the Scandinavian healthcare system is normally known for being a very good healthcare system it has really good data thereof hence it's really good for proving a value with this new technology and we also flew to the west coast of the US to start another collaboration so we had two research partners that we started out with and what we basically did was building the technology within those partnerships and improving the technology first and foremost within retrospective trials and prospective trials that was the kickoff of Cordy so in 2018 we felt confident that we could build the technology could have a technology that could tap into a live dialogue and could have a technology that could understand that dialogue and could have a technology that could actually give valuable feedback within a dialogue so I think that where we are now we're yeah I don't know if I mentioned that we are computing approximately 250,000 dialogues a day now right so it's a lot of data that we're now crunching through our machine learning systems and we have advanced those machine learning systems for that stage in terms of hackathons stuff like that we have been extremely explorative in terms of our research and technology and also in learning from the field so we've had hackathons also with the healthcare providers trying to understand what their actual needs are what their problems are whether we build the right technology and all that we've had that throughout the years and we keep on having it that's incredible and maybe it brings me to you on the technology front Lars talked a bit about a lot of the research they did that allowed them to then scale and come with a solution what was the technology or the choices in technology that allowed the team at Huma to scale at the speed that they did before diving into technologies I think the key vision especially for any other ventures that's entering into digital health and generally in health I think they should be from day one focusing on a path that would enable them to acquire the right regulatory approvals so from day one they have to be having this mindset of what are the key data sets that we need to collect or how should we design the technology in order to be able to gain those approvals fast and prepare ourselves so that once we get to that point we don't have to redo and redefine and rewire a lot of the technology and core capabilities but I think in general the tech choices are of course key and having those let's say cloud first with edge capabilities such as using AWS Google Cloud Platform or Azure for scalability will enable you to work with different stakeholders there are a lot of times that we work with pharma companies or we work with different hospitals and they work with different cloud vendors and the fact that we are quite modular and flexible and working and integrating with these different solutions and capabilities really sets us and gives us that competitive edge of operating and then the other thing I would say the way that we have designed the technology is that it's a low-code easy to use and configurable solution so if from day one especially the fact that most of the technologies will be adopting AI at some point so having that low-code AI deployment capability and framework defined would be super efficient in terms of moving forward and making the technology a success and helping it to be scalable and adaptable and into different settings and what else and having a pre-built data pipeline because a lot of these digital health solutions and technologies definitely need to have that ready available data pipelines to enable them to collect the key currency of building the AI algorithms incredible I liked one of the points on your data pipeline having data pipelines in place and that maybe brings us to our third team of today because we want to use the last couple of minutes we have today together on talking through probably the hardest topic of the three and that's the collaboration models and ethics that you have and when you build these data pipelines to train your models to build your solution there is inevitable bias in the data we process in the data we have access to and let me start with maybe you Michal again the perspective from being leading an innovation hub how do you like what's what's the role of the innovation hub in a way to help these startups train models that reduce the biases that have that keep the performance they need to have while still keeping in mind racial gender disparities in the data sets there what's your point there what's your response what's your view what's your view what's your view what I'm saying is what we have in Israel which is a really lucky thing is that most of the Israeli society they're all ensured and all the data is all arranged in a single place so we have really very rich longitudinal data about most of our patients and we use that a lot and in imaging where there isn't a language barrier because image is an image there is really a treasure and this was probably why and how I got into the field in the first place because we were sitting on tons of information that was ready there very organized very easily accessible and similarly we did a lot of digital pathology at the stage where it wasn't that popular so we had also that ready for research and that made us really very amenable to doing collaborations and we were very pleased to do collaborations with other countries with different kinds of genetics different kinds of clinical information from Japan and places like that to the US to Europe and so we are looking for those kinds of collaborations and there are lots of really interesting tools to enable this collaboration to take place without bridging privacy issues in fact there is actually a chance for it being safer in situations where you join forces from various different sources so we were really lucky in this respect and I think it really pushed us forward to a sense absolutely and having that wealth of data or access to the wealth of data because of national insurances and registries is just phenomenal I think Lars in the Nordics I think the region is known for being one of the first in Europe to adopt electronic medical records and there is a wealth of data there as well one of the downsides to being one of the first to adopt is that when you started filling in these EMRs you asked patients for consent for certain use cases training an AI model is not always a use case consent was asked for so maybe that question there on how do you deal with training a large language model like you guys did on medical data and getting that consent of patients and working through those regulatory hurdles challenges yeah difficult question to really go into depth with so I'm not going to worry too much on the technicalities here but I think that one of the things we have been very aware of and been lucky about coming from where we are I'm based in the US now and we're really seeing a lot of traction in the US and I think that coming from a Danish system is that we have been in need of building these safeguards into our system from the get-go and now we're talking about regulatory landscapes in the US versus Europe I can tell you that the big health systems in the US they're very concerned about consent with the data etc. because they're also concerned about cybersecurity breaches and what not so it's a from my perspective being a company like ours we needed to build it into our architecture from the get-go we needed to build in really complex deployment formats such that we could actually support different regulations within different countries even within the European Union if you look at the regulations in Switzerland you know that it's very difficult different from the regulations in the UK and so forth and then you go to Germany that also have like and France have different regulations and all that we needed to build an infrastructure that could accommodate all those regulations and that is really really coming handy now but it takes a lot of technology and it takes a lot of grit in terms of actually understanding it all and making sure that you're not making mistakes and big newsflash that we've made a lot of mistakes in the way in terms of what we believe was the right architecture with our solution and then learning that we needed to rethink some of the components in order to actually be able to scale while supporting regulations and regulatory environments so I think that building it in from the get-go even though you're an American startup that is fast-paced is smart that makes a lot of sense I think it's important to acknowledge those mistakes made and learn from them and continue building a solution that is more robust and allows for finding the right balance between consent and using that data and Farnas earlier in your demo you showed that there was this software as a medical device checkbox that you could turn on within the application so at Huma as well you faced similar challenges with getting the write-up data but even more so on right getting that software as a medical device regulatory approval can you share a little bit more on advice maybe towards startups listening today how you got to that point why you got to that point from the start and how that all works so when we initially started the work our focus was mainly remote patient monitoring and we started within the area of rare diseases monitoring those patients and through the different partnerships that we had with hospitals and running studies we managed to get the regulatory approval that we have today which is the intended uses covers all patients different disease areas across different ages and the reason being is we managed to tap into the most difficult rare diseases and based on the evidence and the reports and you know the studies that we managed to demonstrate it set the scene that if the application of the solution is regulated in these complicated set of disease areas then it could be applied to a broader set of disease areas so that's one of the reasons that we had managed to have a disease agnostic broad intended use FDA 510k EUMDR class to be and going back to the AI algorithms that you mentioned so this approvals that we have managed to gain throughout the years has also enabled us to create a platform and host different AI algorithms and benefit from the accelerated approval capability that we have so not only us but let's say if you're working with a pharma company that has already built an AI algorithm and they yet haven't validated it or they don't have that regulatory approval they can build and embed their AI algorithm on top of our software development kit and benefit from our existing approvals and roll out an approved AI algorithm to the hands of the patients but overall we not only offer this or have this to ourselves but as I said we offer this to not only pharma and hospitals but also other digital health solution companies that want to get to market fast they can benefit from our approvals partner with us work with us and the whole objective of our CEO is also to accelerate this adoption whether it's for us or for other digital health solution players similar to us early in their journey we will help them to accelerate the go to market that's fantastic to hear companies like Huma reaching out a hand to the early day startups potentially to help them get embedded in the ecosystem my final question for today on this legal aspect or ethics aspect is for you Simon in the UK and in many other places there's a lot of research is funded by public money through charities through grants and the likes how do you find the right balance between these research staying in research and using that public money or that charity money for the betterment and the improvement of patient outcomes and yet and finally companies right spinning out from that research into a company I would love to hear your take on that yeah like many universities we are really driven by curiosity it's very much a bottom-up environment we have about 30 different academic departments in traditional disciplines and there's huge academic freedom to pursue areas of science that people feel will be valuable but perhaps don't quite know how so we are lucky that we have that ability to be curious and roughly about half of our academics are interested in commercialisation as a route to impact from their research whether that's collaborating with the industry or whether that's creating some kind of invention that is licensed out perhaps to a large corporate perhaps to a spin-out part of our role then is to try and get those technologies out as seamlessly as possible and one of the keys around that is just standardising the spin-out process we've done that in the UK with something called the USIT guide which creates the standard terms one area that we're looking at now is particularly in the medical space there are it's not unusual for a researcher to receive say funding from five different sources as they progressed their curiosity journey over the last say five or ten years and so when it gets to the point of spinning out the owners or the contributors to that technology are multiple and part of our role is untangling that to make sure that each of the contributors is comfortable that that technology is ready to go and I think there has to be a role for AI here in getting to a smarter contracting base with all of the contributors to research so that when it comes to the point of spinning out we can more easily arrive at commercial terms that reward everybody in an amicable way and what we're seeing today is many medical research charities wanting a share of the future success of the technology so wanting to have licensing income royalties from the startups back to the medical research charities and they want a big say on how each individual contract is negotiated and as we try to scale up and speed up that that is just not something that's conducive to speed and ultimately the patient is not getting the healthcare treatments as fast as any of us would want so I think there's a role in here for AI agents in smart contracting across not just the startup space but going way back into the research space and in particular the medical research charities. That's an excellent answer to I think is a very difficult question. we are unfortunately out of time for today. I thought it was super interesting. I learned a lot from the four of you. I want to thank all four of you as well for joining me today. My key takeaways here are there's a lot of optimism right. Physicians are indicating they're ready to go and ready to go and work with the tools that Corti and Huma and all the other startups in the ecosystem here in Europe are building. I learned from you Simon that we don't have to be too afraid of running out of researchers or having too many spin outs right. There's room for everyone and there's interesting setups to be had. And just in general I feel there's a huge optimism from the incubators through the startups through the practitioners of a massive change coming to us as patients but also to all the practitioners. With that I want to thank you again all four of you from us Michael Lars Simon. Thank you so much for joining us today and to the audience at home thank you for being with us. I hope this was interesting. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.
